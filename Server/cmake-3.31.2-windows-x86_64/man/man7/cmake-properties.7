.SH PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
.SS ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
.sp
Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.
.sp
Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have
globally unique logical names (see policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0002'\fI\%CMP0002\fP\X'tty: link').
This is necessary to generate meaningful project file names in
\X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link' IDE
generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced
unambiguously.
.sp
Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate \X'tty: link #command:add_custom_target'\fI\%add_custom_target()\fP\X'tty: link'
names.  For projects that care only about \X'tty: link #makefile-generators'\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP\X'tty: link' and do
not wish to support \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link' IDE
generators, one may set this property to \fBTrue\fP
to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property
allows multiple \X'tty: link #command:add_custom_target'\fI\%add_custom_target()\fP\X'tty: link' command calls in different
directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this
property will cause non\-Makefile generators to produce an error and
refuse to generate the project.
.SS AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP
.sp
Added in version 3.9.

.sp
Name of the  \X'tty: link #command:source_group'\fI\%source_group()\fP\X'tty: link' for \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link',
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTORCC'\fI\%AUTORCC\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOUIC'\fI\%AUTOUIC\fP\X'tty: link' generated files.
.sp
Files generated by \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTORCC'\fI\%AUTORCC\fP\X'tty: link' and
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOUIC'\fI\%AUTOUIC\fP\X'tty: link' are not always known at configure time and therefore can\(aqt
be passed to \X'tty: link #command:source_group'\fI\%source_group()\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
\fBAUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP\fP can be used instead to generate or select
a source group for \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTORCC'\fI\%AUTORCC\fP\X'tty: link' and
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOUIC'\fI\%AUTOUIC\fP\X'tty: link' generated files.
.sp
For \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTORCC'\fI\%AUTORCC\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOUIC'\fI\%AUTOUIC\fP\X'tty: link' specific
overrides see \X'tty: link #prop_gbl:AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP'\fI\%AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #prop_gbl:AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP'\fI\%AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP\fP\X'tty: link'
and \X'tty: link #prop_gbl:AUTOUIC_SOURCE_GROUP'\fI\%AUTOUIC_SOURCE_GROUP\fP\X'tty: link' respectively.
.SS AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER
.sp
Name of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FOLDER'\fI\%FOLDER\fP\X'tty: link' for \fB*_autogen\fP targets that are added
automatically by CMake for targets for which \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link' is enabled.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FOLDER'\fI\%FOLDER\fP\X'tty: link' property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FOLDER'\fI\%FOLDER\fP\X'tty: link' target property and the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.SS AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP
.sp
Added in version 3.9.

.sp

.sp
When set this is used instead of \X'tty: link #prop_gbl:AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP'\fI\%AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP\fP\X'tty: link' for
files generated by \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER

CMake for targets for which \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link' is enabled.
.sp
This property is obsolete.  Use \X'tty: link #prop_gbl:AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER'\fI\%AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER\fP\X'tty: link' instead.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FOLDER'\fI\%FOLDER\fP\X'tty: link' property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FOLDER'\fI\%FOLDER\fP\X'tty: link' target property and the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.SS AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP

.SS Low level individual compile features
.sp
For C++ 11 and C++ 14, compilers were sometimes slow to implement certain
language features.  CMake provided some individual compile features to help
projects determine whether specific features were available.  These individual
features are now less relevant and projects should generally prefer to use the
high level meta features instead.  Individual compile features are not provided
for C++ 17 or later.

.sp
CMake automatically analyzes the global inter\-target dependency graph
at the beginning of native build system generation.  It reports an
error if the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist
of all STATIC library targets.  This property tells CMake to disallow
all cycles completely, even among static libraries.
.SS INSTALL_PARALLEL
.sp
Added in version 3.30.

.sp
Enables parallel installation option for a project. The install code for each
subdirectory added with \fBadd_subdirectory\fP can run independently.
.sp
When using the Ninja generator, setting this property to \fBON\fP, causes
\fBinstall/local\fP targets have the console pool disabled, allowing them to run
concurrently.
.sp
This property also provides the target \fBinstall/parallel\fP, which has an
explicit dependency on the \fBinstall/local\fP target for each subdirectory.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Added in version 3.31.

.sp
When this property is \fBON\fP, \fBcmake \-\-install\fP can be given the \fB\-j <jobs>\fP
or \fB\-\-parallel <jobs>\fP option to specify a maximum number of jobs.
The \X'tty: link #envvar:CMAKE_INSTALL_PARALLEL_LEVEL'\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_PARALLEL_LEVEL\fP\X'tty: link' environment variable specifies a
default parallel level if this option is not provided.

.UNINDENT
.sp
Calls to \X'tty: link #code'\fI\%install(CODE)\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link #script'\fI\%install(SCRIPT)\fP\X'tty: link' might depend
on actions performed by an earlier \X'tty: link #command:install'\fI\%install()\fP\X'tty: link' command in a different
directory such as files installed or variable settings. If the project has
such order\-dependent installation logic, parallel installation should be
not be enabled, in order to prevent possible race conditions.
.SS IN_TRY_COMPILE
.sp
Read\-only property that is true during a try\-compile configuration.
.sp
True when building a project inside a \X'tty: link #command:try_compile'\fI\%try_compile()\fP\X'tty: link' or

.SS JOB_POOLS
.sp
Ninja only: List of available pools.
.sp
A pool is a named integer property and defines the maximum number
of concurrent jobs which can be started by a rule assigned to the pool.
The \fBJOB_POOLS\fP property is a semicolon\-separated list of
pairs using the syntax \fBNAME=integer\fP (without a space after the equality sign).
.sp
For instance:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:JOB_POOL_COMPILE'\fI\%JOB_POOL_COMPILE\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:JOB_POOL_LINK'\fI\%JOB_POOL_LINK\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
\X'tty: link #command:add_custom_command'\fI\%Custom commands\fP\X'tty: link' and
\X'tty: link #command:add_custom_target'\fI\%custom targets\fP\X'tty: link' can specify pools using the
option \fBJOB_POOL\fP\&.
Using a pool that is not defined by \fBJOB_POOLS\fP causes
an error by ninja at build time.
.sp
If not set, this property uses the value of the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_JOB_POOLS'\fI\%CMAKE_JOB_POOLS\fP\X'tty: link'
variable.
.sp
Build targets provided by CMake that are meant for individual interactive
use, such as \fBinstall\fP, are placed in the \fBconsole\fP pool automatically.

List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.  Whether a
package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.
.SS PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER
.sp
Name of FOLDER for targets that are added automatically by CMake.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses \(dqCMakePredefinedTargets\(dq as a default value for
this property.  Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and RUN_TESTS will be
organized into this FOLDER.  See also the documentation for the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FOLDER'\fI\%FOLDER\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.SS PROPAGATE_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES_TO_TRY_COMPILE
.sp

.sp
When this global property is set to true, the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES'\fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES\fP\X'tty: link' variable is propagated into
\X'tty: link #command:try_compile'\fI\%try_compile()\fP\X'tty: link' calls that use the
\X'tty: link #try-compiling-whole-projects'\fI\%whole\-project signature\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
Calls to the \X'tty: link #try-compiling-source-files'\fI\%source file signature\fP\X'tty: link' are not
affected by this property.
\fBPROPAGATE_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES_TO_TRY_COMPILE\fP is unset by default.
.sp
For \X'tty: link #dependency-providers-overview'\fI\%dependency providers\fP\X'tty: link' that want to
be enabled in whole\-project \X'tty: link #command:try_compile'\fI\%try_compile()\fP\X'tty: link' calls, set this global
property to true just before or after registering the provider.
Note that all files listed in \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES'\fI\%CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES\fP\X'tty: link'
will need to be able to handle being included in such \X'tty: link #command:try_compile'\fI\%try_compile()\fP\X'tty: link'
calls, and it is the user\(aqs responsibility to ensure this.
.SS REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
.sp
If set, report any undefined properties to this file.
.sp
If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will
report any properties or variables that were accessed but not defined
into the filename specified in this property.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
.sp

because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.
.SS RULE_MESSAGES
.sp
Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.
.sp
This property specifies whether Makefile generators should add a
progress message describing what each build rule does.  If the
property is not set the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to
disable granular messages and report only as each target completes.
This is intended to allow scripted builds to avoid the build time cost
of detailed reports.  If a \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES'\fI\%CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES\fP\X'tty: link' cache entry exists
its value initializes the value of this property.  Non\-Makefile
generators currently ignore this property.
.SS TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
.sp
Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.
.sp
On AIX shared libraries may be named \(dqlib<name>.a\(dq.  This property is
set to true on such platforms.
.SS TARGET_MESSAGES
.sp
Added in version 3.4.

.sp
Specify whether to report the completion of each target.
.sp
This property specifies whether \X'tty: link #makefile-generators'\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP\X'tty: link' should
add a progress message describing that each target has been completed.
If the property is not set the default is \fBON\fP\&.  Set the property
to \fBOFF\fP to disable target completion messages.
.sp
This option is intended to reduce build output when little or no
work needs to be done to bring the build tree up to date.
.sp
If a \fBCMAKE_TARGET_MESSAGES\fP cache entry exists its value
initializes the value of this property.
.sp
Non\-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.
.sp
See the counterpart property \X'tty: link #prop_gbl:RULE_MESSAGES'\fI\%RULE_MESSAGES\fP\X'tty: link' to disable
everything except for target completion messages.
.SS TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
.sp
Does the target platform support shared libraries.
.sp
\fBTARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS\fP is a boolean specifying whether the target
platform supports shared libraries.  Basically all current general
purpose OS do so, the exceptions are usually embedded systems
with no or special OSs.
.SS USE_FOLDERS
.sp
Controls whether to use the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FOLDER'\fI\%FOLDER\fP\X'tty: link' target property to organize
targets into folders.  The value of \fBUSE_FOLDERS\fP at the end of the top level
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file is what determines the behavior.
.sp
Changed in version 3.26: CMake treats this property as \fBON\fP by default.
See policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0143'\fI\%CMP0143\fP\X'tty: link'\&.

.sp
Not all CMake generators support recording folder details for targets.
The \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio\fP\X'tty: link'
generators are examples of generators that do.  Similarly, not all IDEs
support presenting targets using folder hierarchies, even if the CMake
generator used provides the necessary information.
.SS XCODE_EMIT_EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME
.sp
Added in version 3.8.

.sp
Control emission of \fBEFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME\fP by the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link'
generator.
.sp
It is required for building the same target with multiple SDKs. A
common use case is the parallel use of \fBiphoneos\fP and
\fBiphonesimulator\fP SDKs.
.sp
Three different states possible that control when the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link'
generator emits the \fBEFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME\fP variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If set to \fBON\fP it will always be emitted
.IP \(bu 2
If set to \fBOFF\fP it will never be emitted
.IP \(bu 2
If unset (the default) it will only be emitted when the project was
configured for an embedded Xcode SDK like iOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS
or any of the simulators.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When this behavior is enable for generated Xcode projects, the
\fBEFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME\fP variable will leak into
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%Generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'
like \fBTARGET_FILE\fP and will render those mostly unusable.
.UNINDENT

.SH PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES
.SS ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES
.sp
Added in version 3.15.

.sp
A \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%;\-list\fP\X'tty: link' of files or directories that will be
removed as a part of the global \fBclean\fP target.  It is useful for
specifying generated files or directories that are used by multiple targets
or by CMake itself, or that are generated in ways which cannot be captured as
outputs or byproducts of custom commands.
.sp
If an additional clean file is specific to a single target only, then the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES'\fI\%ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES\fP\X'tty: link' target property would usually be a better
choice than this directory property.
.sp
Relative paths are allowed and are interpreted relative to the
current binary directory.
.sp
Contents of \fBADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES\fP may use
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
This property only works for the \X'tty: link #generator:Ninja'\fI\%Ninja\fP\X'tty: link' and the Makefile
generators.  It is ignored by other generators.
.SS BINARY_DIR
.sp
Added in version 3.7.

.sp
This read\-only directory property reports absolute path to the binary
directory corresponding to the source on which it is read.
.SS BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS
.sp
Added in version 3.7.

.sp
This read\-only directory property contains a
\X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of buildsystem targets added in the
directory by calls to the \X'tty: link #command:add_library'\fI\%add_library()\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #command:add_executable'\fI\%add_executable()\fP\X'tty: link',
and \X'tty: link #command:add_custom_target'\fI\%add_custom_target()\fP\X'tty: link' commands.  The list does not include any
\X'tty: link #imported-targets'\fI\%Imported Targets\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link #alias-targets'\fI\%Alias Targets\fP\X'tty: link', but does include
\X'tty: link #interface-libraries'\fI\%Interface Libraries\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  Each entry in the list is the logical name
of a target, suitable to pass to the \X'tty: link #command:get_property'\fI\%get_property()\fP\X'tty: link' command
\fBTARGET\fP option.
.sp
See also the \X'tty: link #prop_dir:IMPORTED_TARGETS'\fI\%IMPORTED_TARGETS\fP\X'tty: link' directory property.
.SS CACHE_VARIABLES
.sp
List of cache variables available in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake cache variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.
.SS CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
.sp
Set to true to tell \X'tty: link #makefile-generators'\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP\X'tty: link' not to remove the outputs of
custom commands for this directory during the \fBmake clean\fP operation.
This is ignored on other generators because it is not possible to implement.
.SS CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS
.sp
Tell CMake about additional input files to the configuration process.
If any named file is modified the build system will re\-run CMake to
re\-configure the file and generate the build system again.
.sp
Specify files as a semicolon\-separated list of paths.  Relative paths
are interpreted as relative to the current source directory.
.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory\(aqs sources.
.sp
This property specifies the list of options given so far to the
\X'tty: link #command:add_compile_definitions'\fI\%add_compile_definitions()\fP\X'tty: link' (or \X'tty: link #command:add_definitions'\fI\%add_definitions()\fP\X'tty: link') command.
.sp
The \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP property may be set to a semicolon\-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax \fBVAR\fP or \fBVAR=value\fP\&.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).
.sp
This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the
directory\(aqs parent.
.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.
.sp
Added in version 3.26: Any leading \fB\-D\fP on an item will be removed.

.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

manual for available expressions.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-buildsystem(7)'\fI\%cmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP\X'tty: link'
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.sp
The corresponding \X'tty: link #prop_dir:COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>'\fI\%COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' property may
be set to specify per\-configuration definitions.  Generator expressions
should be preferred instead of setting the alternative property.
.SS COMPILE_OPTIONS
.sp
List of options to pass to the compiler.
.sp
This property holds a \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of options
given so far to the \X'tty: link #command:add_compile_options'\fI\%add_compile_options()\fP\X'tty: link' command.
.sp
This property is used to initialize the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:COMPILE_OPTIONS'\fI\%COMPILE_OPTIONS\fP\X'tty: link' target
property when a target is created, which is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBCOMPILE_OPTIONS\fP may use \(dqgenerator expressions\(dq with the
syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual
for available expressions.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-buildsystem(7)'\fI\%cmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS DEFINITIONS
.sp
For CMake 2.4 compatibility only.  Use \X'tty: link #prop_dir:COMPILE_DEFINITIONS'\fI\%COMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP\X'tty: link'
instead.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of flags given so far to
the \X'tty: link #command:add_definitions'\fI\%add_definitions()\fP\X'tty: link' command.  It is intended for debugging
purposes.  Use the \X'tty: link #prop_dir:COMPILE_DEFINITIONS'\fI\%COMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP\X'tty: link' directory property
instead.
.sp
This built\-in read\-only property does not exist if policy
\X'tty: link #policy:CMP0059'\fI\%CMP0059\fP\X'tty: link' is set to \fBNEW\fP\&.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
.sp
Set this directory property to a true value on a subdirectory to exclude
its targets from the \(dqall\(dq target of its ancestors.  If excluded, running
e.g. \fBmake\fP in the parent directory will not build targets the
subdirectory by default.  This does not affect the \(dqall\(dq target of the
subdirectory itself.  Running e.g. \fBmake\fP inside the subdirectory will
still build its targets.
.sp
\fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP is meant for when the subdirectory contains
a separate part of the project that is useful, but not necessary,
such as a set of examples, or e.g. an integrated 3rd party library.
Typically the subdirectory should contain its own \X'tty: link #command:project'\fI\%project()\fP\X'tty: link'
command invocation so that a full build system will be generated in the
subdirectory (such as a Visual Studio IDE solution file).  Note that
inter\-target dependencies supersede this exclusion.  If a target built by
the parent project depends on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee
target will be included in the parent project build system to satisfy
the dependency.
.sp
If the \fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP argument is provided, it has the following effects:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Targets defined in the subdirectory or below will not be
included in the \fBALL\fP target of the parent directory.
Those targets must be built explicitly by the user,
or be a dependency of another target that will be built.
.IP \(bu 2
Targets defined in the subdirectory or below will be
excluded from IDE project files.
.IP \(bu 2
Any install rules defined in the subdirectory or below will
be ignored when installing the parent directory.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that these effects are not the same as those for the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL'\fI\%EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.SS IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
.sp
Specify \fB#include\fP line transforms for dependencies in a directory.
.sp
This property specifies rules to transform macro\-like \fB#include\fP lines
during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
list of rules must be semicolon\-separated with each entry of the form
\fBA_MACRO(%)=value\-with\-%\fP (the \fB%\fP must be literal).  During dependency
scanning occurrences of \fBA_MACRO(...)\fP on \fB#include\fP lines will be
replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
\fB%\fP\&.  For example, the entry
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
MYDIR(%)=<mydir/%>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.sp
This property applies to sources in all targets within a directory.
The property value is initialized in each directory by its value in
the directory\(aqs parent.
.SS IMPORTED_TARGETS
.sp
Added in version 3.21.

.sp
This read\-only directory property contains a
\X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of
\X'tty: link #imported-targets'\fI\%Imported Targets\fP\X'tty: link' added in the directory by calls to the
\X'tty: link #command:add_library'\fI\%add_library()\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #command:add_executable'\fI\%add_executable()\fP\X'tty: link' commands.
Each entry in the list is the logical name of a target, suitable
to pass to the \X'tty: link #command:get_property'\fI\%get_property()\fP\X'tty: link' command \fBTARGET\fP option
when called in the same directory.
.sp
See also the \X'tty: link #prop_dir:BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS'\fI\%BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS\fP\X'tty: link' directory property.
.SS INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of preprocessor include file search directories.
.sp
This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
\X'tty: link #command:include_directories'\fI\%include_directories()\fP\X'tty: link' command.
.sp
This property is used to populate the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link'
target property, which is used by the generators to set the include
directories for the compiler.
.sp
In addition to accepting values from that command, values may be set
directly on any directory using the \X'tty: link #command:set_property'\fI\%set_property()\fP\X'tty: link' command, and can be
set on the current directory using the \X'tty: link #command:set_directory_properties'\fI\%set_directory_properties()\fP\X'tty: link'
command.  A directory gets its initial value from its parent directory if it has
one.  The initial value of the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' target property
comes from the value of this property.  Both directory and target property
values are adjusted by calls to the \X'tty: link #command:include_directories'\fI\%include_directories()\fP\X'tty: link' command.
Calls to \X'tty: link #command:set_property'\fI\%set_property()\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link #command:set_directory_properties'\fI\%set_directory_properties()\fP\X'tty: link',
however, will update the directory property value without updating target
property values.  Therefore direct property updates must be made before
calls to \X'tty: link #command:add_executable'\fI\%add_executable()\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link #command:add_library'\fI\%add_library()\fP\X'tty: link' for targets
they are meant to affect.
.sp
The target property values are used by the generators to set the
include paths for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use \(dqgenerator expressions\(dq with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP\X'tty: link'
manual for available expressions.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-buildsystem(7)'\fI\%cmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP\X'tty: link'
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
Include file scanning regular expression.
.sp
This property specifies the regular expression used during
dependency scanning to match include files that should be followed.
See the \X'tty: link #command:include_regular_expression'\fI\%include_regular_expression()\fP\X'tty: link' command for a high\-level
interface to set this property.
.SS LABELS
.sp
Added in version 3.10.

.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a directory and all of its
subdirectories. This is equivalent to setting the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LABELS'\fI\%LABELS\fP\X'tty: link' target
property and the \X'tty: link #prop_test:LABELS'\fI\%LABELS\fP\X'tty: link' test property on all targets and tests in
the current directory and subdirectories. Note: Launchers must enabled to
propagate labels to targets.
.sp
The \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS'\fI\%CMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS\fP\X'tty: link' variable can be used to initialize this
property.
.sp
The list is reported in dashboard submissions.
.SS LINK_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of linker search directories.
.sp
This property holds a \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of directories
and is typically populated using the \X'tty: link #command:link_directories'\fI\%link_directories()\fP\X'tty: link' command.
It gets its initial value from its parent directory, if it has one.
.sp
The directory property is used to initialize the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%LINK_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link'
target property when a target is created.  That target property is used
by the generators to set the library search directories for the linker.
.sp
Contents of \fBLINK_DIRECTORIES\fP may use \(dqgenerator expressions\(dq with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP\X'tty: link'
manual for available expressions.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-buildsystem(7)'\fI\%cmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP\X'tty: link'
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS LINK_OPTIONS
.sp
Added in version 3.13.

.sp
List of options to use for the link step of shared library, module
and executable targets as well as the device link step.
.sp
This property holds a \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of options
given so far to the \X'tty: link #command:add_link_options'\fI\%add_link_options()\fP\X'tty: link' command.
.sp
This property is used to initialize the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_OPTIONS'\fI\%LINK_OPTIONS\fP\X'tty: link' target
property when a target is created, which is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBLINK_OPTIONS\fP may use \(dqgenerator expressions\(dq with the
syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual
for available expressions.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-buildsystem(7)'\fI\%cmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS LISTFILE_STACK
.sp
The current stack of listfiles being processed.
.sp
This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your
CMake scripts.  It returns a list of what list files are currently
being processed, in order.  So if one listfile does an
\X'tty: link #command:include'\fI\%include()\fP\X'tty: link' command then that is effectively pushing the
included listfile onto the stack.
.SS MACROS
.sp
List of macro commands available in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake macros currently
defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.  See the \X'tty: link #command:macro'\fI\%macro()\fP\X'tty: link'
command.
.SS PARENT_DIRECTORY
.sp
Source directory that added current subdirectory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the source directory that added the
current source directory as a subdirectory of the build.  In the
top\-level directory the value is the empty\-string.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE

Added in version 3.7.

.sp
This read\-only directory property reports absolute path to the source
directory on which it is read.
.SS SUBDIRECTORIES
.sp
Added in version 3.7.

.sp
This read\-only directory property contains a
\X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of subdirectories processed so far by
the \X'tty: link #command:add_subdirectory'\fI\%add_subdirectory()\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link #command:subdirs'\fI\%subdirs()\fP\X'tty: link' commands.  Each entry is
the absolute path to the source directory (containing the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP

.sp
This directory property is used to initialize the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SYSTEM'\fI\%SYSTEM\fP\X'tty: link'
target property for non\-imported targets created in that directory.
It is set to true by \X'tty: link #command:add_subdirectory'\fI\%add_subdirectory()\fP\X'tty: link' and
\X'tty: link #command:fetchcontent_declare'\fI\%FetchContent_Declare()\fP\X'tty: link' when the \fBSYSTEM\fP option is given
as an argument to those commands.
.SS TESTS
.sp
Added in version 3.12.

.sp
List of tests.
.sp
This read\-only property holds a
\X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of tests
defined so far, in the current directory, by the \X'tty: link #command:add_test'\fI\%add_test()\fP\X'tty: link' command.
.SS TEST_INCLUDE_FILES
.sp
Added in version 3.10.

.sp
A list of cmake files that will be included when ctest is run.
.sp
If you specify \fBTEST_INCLUDE_FILES\fP, those files will be included and
processed when ctest is run on the directory.
.SS VARIABLES
.sp
List of variables defined in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.
.SS VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_<section>
.sp
Specify a postSolution global section in Visual Studio.

List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.
.sp
This property only works for \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link'; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP contains a \X'tty: link #command:project'\fI\%project()\fP\X'tty: link' command.
.sp
Note that CMake generates postSolution sections \fBExtensibilityGlobals\fP
and \fBExtensibilityAddIns\fP by default.  If you set the corresponding
property, it will override the default section.  For example, setting
\fBVS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals\fP will override the default
contents of the \fBExtensibilityGlobals\fP section, while keeping
ExtensibilityAddIns on its default.  However, CMake will always
add a \fBSolutionGuid\fP to the \fBExtensibilityGlobals\fP section
if it is not specified explicitly.
.SS VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_PRE_<section>
.sp
Specify a preSolution global section in Visual Studio.
.sp
Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
in the solution file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
GlobalSection(<section>) = preSolution
  <contents based on property value>
EndGlobalSection
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The property must be set to a semicolon\-separated list of \fBkey=value\fP
pairs.  Each such pair will be transformed into an entry in the
solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.
.sp
This property only works for \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link'; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP contains a \X'tty: link #command:project'\fI\%project()\fP\X'tty: link' command.
.SS VS_STARTUP_PROJECT
.sp
Added in version 3.6.

.sp
Specify the default startup project in a Visual Studio solution.
.sp
The \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link' create a \fB\&.sln\fP file for each directory
whose \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file calls the \X'tty: link #command:project'\fI\%project()\fP\X'tty: link' command.  Set this
property in the same directory as a \X'tty: link #command:project'\fI\%project()\fP\X'tty: link' command call (e.g. in
the top\-level \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file) to specify the default startup project
for the corresponding solution file.
.sp
The property must be set to the name of an existing target.  This
will cause that project to be listed first in the generated solution
file causing Visual Studio to make it the startup project if the
solution has never been opened before.
.sp
If this property is not specified, then the \fBALL_BUILD\fP project
will be the default.
.SH PROPERTIES ON TARGETS
.SS ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES
.sp
Added in version 3.15.

.sp
A \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%;\-list\fP\X'tty: link' of files or directories that will be
removed as a part of the global \fBclean\fP target.  It can be used to specify
files and directories that are generated as part of building the target or
that are directly associated with the target in some way (e.g. created as a
result of running the target).
.sp
For custom targets, if such files can be captured as outputs or byproducts
instead, then that should be preferred over adding them to this property.
If an additional clean file is used by multiple targets or isn\(aqt
target\-specific, then the \X'tty: link #prop_dir:ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES'\fI\%ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES\fP\X'tty: link' directory
property may be the more appropriate property to use.
.sp
Relative paths are allowed and are interpreted relative to the
current binary directory.
.sp
Contents of \fBADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES\fP may use
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
This property only works for the \X'tty: link #generator:Ninja'\fI\%Ninja\fP\X'tty: link' and the Makefile
generators.  It is ignored by other generators.
.SS AIX_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS
.sp
Added in version 3.17.

.sp
On AIX, CMake automatically exports all symbols from shared libraries, and
from executables with the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:ENABLE_EXPORTS'\fI\%ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP\X'tty: link' target property set.
Explicitly disable this boolean property to suppress the behavior and
export no symbols by default.  In this case it is expected that the project
will use other means to export some symbols.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_AIX_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS'\fI\%CMAKE_AIX_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE
.sp
Added in version 3.31.

.sp
On AIX, enable creation of a shared library archive.  This places
the shared object \fB\&.so\fP file inside an archive \fB\&.a\fP file.
.sp
By default, CMake creates shared libraries on AIX as plain
shared object \fB\&.so\fP files for consistency with other UNIX platforms.
Alternatively, set this property to a true value to create a shared
library archive instead, as is AIX convention.
.sp
The shared object name in the archive encodes version information from
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link' target property, if set, and otherwise from
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:VERSION'\fI\%VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' target property, if set.
.sp
This property defaults to \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE'\fI\%CMAKE_AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE\fP\X'tty: link'
if that variable is set when a non\-imported \fBSHARED\fP library target
is created by \X'tty: link #command:add_library'\fI\%add_library()\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  Imported targets must explicitly
enable \fBAIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE\fP if they import an AIX
shared library archive.
.SS ALIAS_GLOBAL

option for \fBmoc\fP on \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link' enabled Qt targets.
.sp
To generate the path prefix, CMake tests if the header compiled by \fBmoc\fP
is in any of the target
\X'tty: link #command:target_include_directories'\fI\%include directories\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  If so, CMake will
compute the relative path accordingly.  If the header is not in the
\X'tty: link #command:target_include_directories'\fI\%include directories\fP\X'tty: link', CMake will omit
the \fB\-p\fP path prefix option.  \fBmoc\fP usually generates a
relative include path in that case.
.sp
\fBAUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX\fP is initialized from the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX'\fI\%CMAKE_AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX\fP\X'tty: link', which is \fBOFF\fP by default.

When this property is \fBON\fP, CMake will handle \fB\&.qrc\fP files added

This property is initialized by the value of the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_AUTORCC'\fI\%CMAKE_AUTORCC\fP\X'tty: link'

.SS AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS
.sp
Added in version 3.9.

.sp
Search path list used by \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOUIC'\fI\%AUTOUIC\fP\X'tty: link' to find included
\fB\&.ui\fP files.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS'\fI\%CMAKE_AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set
when a target is created. Otherwise it is empty.

.SS BINARY_DIR
.sp
Added in version 3.4.

.sp
This read\-only property reports the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR'\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP\X'tty: link' variable in the directory in which
the target was defined.
.SS BUILD_RPATH
.sp
Added in version 3.8.

.sp
A \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' specifying
runtime path (\fBRPATH\fP) entries to add to binaries linked in the
build tree (for platforms that support it).  By default, CMake sets
the runtime path of binaries in the build tree to contain search
paths it knows are needed to find the shared libraries they link.
Projects may set \fBBUILD_RPATH\fP to specify additional search paths.
.sp
The build\-tree runtime path will \fInot\fP be used for binaries in the
install tree.  It will be replaced with the install\-tree runtime path
during the installation step.  See also the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_RPATH'\fI\%INSTALL_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link'
target property.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH'\fI\%CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
This property supports
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
Other settings that affect the build\-tree runtime path include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH'\fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' variable completely disables runtime
paths in both the build tree and install tree.
.IP \(bu 2
The \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SKIP_BUILD_RPATH'\fI\%SKIP_BUILD_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' target property disables setting any
runtime path in the build tree.
.IP \(bu 2
The \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN'\fI\%BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN\fP\X'tty: link' target property causes the
automatically\-generated runtime path to use entries relative to \fB$ORIGIN\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH'\fI\%BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' target property causes binaries
in the build tree to be built with the install\-tree runtime path.
.UNINDENT
.SS BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN
.sp
Added in version 3.14.

.sp
Whether to use relative paths for the build \fBRPATH\fP\&.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN'\fI\%CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
On platforms that support runtime paths (\fBRPATH\fP) with the
\fB$ORIGIN\fP token, setting this property to \fBTRUE\fP enables relative
paths in the build \fBRPATH\fP for executables and shared libraries that
point to shared libraries in the same build tree.
.sp
Normally the build \fBRPATH\fP of a binary contains absolute paths
to the directory of each shared library it links to.  The \fBRPATH\fP
entries for directories contained within the build tree can be made
relative to enable relocatable builds and to help achieve reproducible
builds by omitting the build directory from the build environment.
.sp
This property has no effect on platforms that do not support the
\fB$ORIGIN\fP token in \fBRPATH\fP, or when the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH'\fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link'
variable is set. The runtime path set through the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUILD_RPATH'\fI\%BUILD_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' target property is also unaffected by this
property.
.SS BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
.sp
Added in version 3.9.

.sp
\fBBUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP is a boolean specifying whether the macOS
\fBinstall_name\fP of a target in the build tree uses the directory given by
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_NAME_DIR'\fI\%INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  This setting only applies to targets on macOS.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR'\fI\%CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
If this property is not set and policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0068'\fI\%CMP0068\fP\X'tty: link' is not \fBNEW\fP, the
value of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH'\fI\%BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' is used in its place.
.SS BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
.sp
\fBBUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH\fP is a boolean specifying whether to link the target
in the build tree with the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_RPATH'\fI\%INSTALL_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  This takes precedence
over \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SKIP_BUILD_RPATH'\fI\%SKIP_BUILD_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' and avoids the need for relinking before
installation.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH'\fI\%CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.sp
If policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0068'\fI\%CMP0068\fP\X'tty: link' is not \fBNEW\fP, this property also controls use of
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_NAME_DIR'\fI\%INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\X'tty: link' in the build tree on macOS.  Either way, the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR'\fI\%BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\X'tty: link' target property takes precedence.
.SS BUNDLE
.sp
This target is a \fBCFBundle\fP on the macOS.
.sp
If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a \fBCFBundle\fP when built on the mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a \fBCFBundle\fP and will be suitable to be used for
creating Browser Plugins or other application resources.
.SS BUNDLE_EXTENSION
.sp
The file extension used to name a \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUNDLE'\fI\%BUNDLE\fP\X'tty: link', a \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FRAMEWORK'\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link',
or a \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACOSX_BUNDLE'\fI\%MACOSX_BUNDLE\fP\X'tty: link' target on the macOS and iOS.
.sp
The default value is \fBbundle\fP, \fBframework\fP, or \fBapp\fP for the respective
target types.
.SS C_EXTENSIONS
.sp
Added in version 3.1.

.sp
Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.
.sp
This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as \fB\-std=gnu11\fP instead of \fB\-std=c11\fP to the compile line.  This
property is \fBON\fP by default. The basic C standard level is
controlled by the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:C_STANDARD'\fI\%C_STANDARD\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.sp
See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-compile-features(7)'\fI\%cmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS'\fI\%CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS\fP\X'tty: link' variable if set when a target is created and
otherwise by the value of
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_<LANG>_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT'\fI\%CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT\fP\X'tty: link' (see
\X'tty: link #policy:CMP0128'\fI\%CMP0128\fP\X'tty: link').
.SS C_STANDARD
.sp
Added in version 3.1.

.sp
The C standard whose features are requested to build this target.
.sp
This property specifies the C standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as \fB\-std=gnu11\fP to the compile line.  For compilers that
have no notion of a C standard level, such as Microsoft Visual C++ before
VS 16.7, this property has no effect.
.sp

be controlled with the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:C_STANDARD_REQUIRED'\fI\%C_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
Additionally, the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:C_EXTENSIONS'\fI\%C_EXTENSIONS\fP\X'tty: link' target property may be used to
control whether compiler\-specific extensions are enabled on a per\-target basis.
.sp
See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-compile-features(7)'\fI\%cmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual for information on

.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_C_STANDARD'\fI\%CMAKE_C_STANDARD\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set when a target

.SS C_STANDARD_REQUIRED
.sp
Added in version 3.1.

.sp
Boolean describing whether the value of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:C_STANDARD'\fI\%C_STANDARD\fP\X'tty: link' is a requirement.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBON\fP, then the value of the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:C_STANDARD'\fI\%C_STANDARD\fP\X'tty: link' target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is \fBOFF\fP or unset, the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:C_STANDARD'\fI\%C_STANDARD\fP\X'tty: link' target property is
treated as optional and may \(dqdecay\(dq to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a C standard level, such
as Microsoft Visual C++ before VS 16.7, this property has no effect.
.sp
See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-compile-features(7)'\fI\%cmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual for information on

.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL
.sp
Properties which must be compatible with their link interface
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be consistent when evaluated as a
boolean with the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property in all linked
dependees.  For example, if a property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then
for each dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its
dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with the \fBFOO\fP
property in the depender.
.sp
Consistency in this sense has the meaning that if the property is set,
then it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if the
property is not set, then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
\X'tty: link #compatible-interface-properties'\fI\%Compatible Interface Properties\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX
.sp
Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose maximum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property in all
linked dependees.  For example, if a property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list,
then for each dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of
its dependencies will be compared with each other and with the \fBFOO\fP
property in the depender.  When reading the \fBFOO\fP property at generate
time, the maximum value will be returned. If the property is not set,
then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
\X'tty: link #compatible-interface-properties'\fI\%Compatible Interface Properties\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN
.sp
Properties whose minimum value from the link interface will be used.
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose minimum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property of all
linked dependees.  For example, if a
property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
\fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its dependencies will be
compared with each other and with the \fBFOO\fP property in the depender.
When reading the \fBFOO\fP property at generate time, the minimum value
will be returned.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
\X'tty: link #compatible-interface-properties'\fI\%Compatible Interface Properties\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING
.sp
Properties which must be string\-compatible with their link interface
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be the same when evaluated as a
string in the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property all linked dependees.
For example, if a property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then for each
dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its
dependencies must be equal with each other, and with the \fBFOO\fP property
in the depender.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
\X'tty: link #compatible-interface-properties'\fI\%Compatible Interface Properties\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target\(aqs sources.
.sp
The \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP property may be set to a semicolon\-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax \fBVAR\fP or \fBVAR=value\fP\&.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).
.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.
.sp
Added in version 3.26: Any leading \fB\-D\fP on an item will be removed.

.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

.SS Option De\-duplication
.sp
The final set of options used for a target is constructed by
accumulating options from the current target and the usage requirements of
its dependencies.  The set of options is de\-duplicated to avoid repetition.
.sp
Added in version 3.12: While beneficial for individual options, the de\-duplication step can break
up option groups.  For example, \fB\-option A \-option B\fP becomes
\fB\-option A B\fP\&.  One may specify a group of options using shell\-like
quoting along with a \fBSHELL:\fP prefix.  The \fBSHELL:\fP prefix is dropped,
and the rest of the option string is parsed using the
\X'tty: link #command:separate_arguments'\fI\%separate_arguments()\fP\X'tty: link' \fBUNIX_COMMAND\fP mode. For example,
\fB\(dqSHELL:\-option A\(dq \(dqSHELL:\-option B\(dq\fP becomes \fB\-option A \-option B\fP\&.

CUDA only: Enables device linking for the specific library target where

device symbols at the same time when they are used by a shared library or

\X'tty: link #prop_sf:CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES'\fI\%CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES\fP\X'tty: link' for per\-source settings which, if set,
overrides the target\-wide settings.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES'\fI\%CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
When this property is set \fBON\fP or unset, CMake will scan the target\(aqs
\fBCXX\fP sources at build time and add module dependency information to the
compile line as necessary.  When this property is set \fBOFF\fP, CMake will not
scan the target\(aqs \fBCXX\fP sources at build time.
.sp
Note that scanning is only performed if C++20 or higher is enabled for the
target.  Scanning for modules in the target\(aqs sources belonging to file sets
of type \fBCXX_MODULES\fP is always performed.
.SS CXX_STANDARD
.sp
Added in version 3.1.

.sp
The C++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.
.sp
This property specifies the C++ standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP to the compile line.  For compilers that
have no notion of a standard level, such as Microsoft Visual C++ before
2015 Update 3, this has no effect.
.sp

with the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED'\fI\%CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
Additionally, the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:CXX_EXTENSIONS'\fI\%CXX_EXTENSIONS\fP\X'tty: link' target property may be used to
control whether compiler\-specific extensions are enabled on a per\-target basis.
.sp
See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-compile-features(7)'\fI\%cmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD'\fI\%CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED
.sp
Added in version 3.1.

.sp
Boolean describing whether the value of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:CXX_STANDARD'\fI\%CXX_STANDARD\fP\X'tty: link' is a requirement.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBON\fP, then the value of the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:CXX_STANDARD'\fI\%CXX_STANDARD\fP\X'tty: link' target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is \fBOFF\fP or unset, the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:CXX_STANDARD'\fI\%CXX_STANDARD\fP\X'tty: link' target property is
treated as optional and may \(dqdecay\(dq to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as
MSVC 1800 (Visual Studio 2013) and lower, this has no effect.
.sp
See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-compile-features(7)'\fI\%cmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual for information on

This property is initialized by the value of
the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED'\fI\%CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS DEBUG_POSTFIX
.sp
See target property \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:<CONFIG>_POSTFIX'\fI\%<CONFIG>_POSTFIX\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
This property is a special case of the more\-general \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:<CONFIG>_POSTFIX'\fI\%<CONFIG>_POSTFIX\fP\X'tty: link'
property for the \fBDEBUG\fP configuration.
.SS DEFINE_SYMBOL
.sp
Define a symbol when compiling this target\(aqs sources.
.sp
\fBDEFINE_SYMBOL\fP sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when
compiling sources in a shared library.  If not set here then it is set
to \fBtarget_EXPORTS\fP by default (with some substitutions if the target is
not a valid C identifier).  This is useful for headers to know whether
they are being included from inside their library or outside to
properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations on Windows.
.sp
On POSIX platforms, this can optionally be used to control the visibility
of symbols.
.sp
CMake provides support for such decorations with the \X'tty: link #module:GenerateExportHeader'\fI\%GenerateExportHeader\fP\X'tty: link'
module.
.SS DEPLOYMENT_ADDITIONAL_FILES
.sp
Added in version 3.13.

.sp
Set the WinCE project \fBAdditionalFiles\fP in \fBDeploymentTool\fP in \fB\&.vcproj\fP
files generated by the \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
This is useful when you want to debug on remote WinCE device.

Disables the precompilation of header files specified by
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:PRECOMPILE_HEADERS'\fI\%PRECOMPILE_HEADERS\fP\X'tty: link' property.

If the property is not set, CMake will use the value provided
by \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS'\fI\%CMAKE_DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS DLL_NAME_WITH_SOVERSION
.sp
Added in version 3.27.

.sp
This property controls whether the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link' target
property is added to the filename of generated DLL filenames
for the Windows platform, which is selected when the
\X'tty: link #variable:WIN32'\fI\%WIN32\fP\X'tty: link' variable is set.
.sp
The value of the listed property is appended to the
basename of the runtime component of the shared library
target as \fB\-<SOVERSION>\fP\&.
.sp
Please note that setting this property has no effect
if versioned filenames are globally disabled with the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_PLATFORM_NO_VERSIONED_SONAME'\fI\%CMAKE_PLATFORM_NO_VERSIONED_SONAME\fP\X'tty: link' variable.
.SS DOTNET_SDK
.sp
Added in version 3.23.

.sp
Specify the .NET SDK for C# projects.  For example: \fBMicrosoft.NET.Sdk\fP\&.
.sp
This property tells \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link' for VS 2019 and
above to generate a .NET SDK\-style project using the specified SDK.
The property is meaningful only to these generators, and only in C#
targets.  It is ignored for C++ projects, even if they are managed
(e.g. using \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME'\fI\%COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME\fP\X'tty: link').
.sp
This property must be a non\-empty string to generate .NET SDK\-style projects.
CMake does not perform any validations for the value of the property.
.sp
This property may be initialized for all targets using the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_DOTNET_SDK'\fI\%CMAKE_DOTNET_SDK\fP\X'tty: link' variable.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0

.SS DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK
.sp
Added in version 3.17.

.sp
Specify the .NET target framework.
.sp
Used to specify the .NET target framework for C++/CLI and C#.  For
example: \fBnetcoreapp2.1\fP\&.
.sp
This property is only evaluated for \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link'
VS 2010 and above.
.sp
Can be initialized for all targets using the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK'\fI\%CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION
.sp
Added in version 3.12.

.sp
Specify the .NET target framework version.
.sp
Used to specify the .NET target framework version for C++/CLI and C#.
For example: \fBv4.5\fP\&.
.sp
This property is only evaluated for \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link'
VS 2010 and above.
.sp
To initialize this variable for all targets set
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK'\fI\%CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link' or
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION'\fI\%CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link'\&. If both are set,
the latter is ignored.
.SS EchoString
.sp
A message to be displayed when the target is built.
.sp
A message to display on some generators (such as \X'tty: link #makefile-generators'\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP\X'tty: link')
when the target is built.
.SS ENABLE_EXPORTS
.sp
Specify whether an executable or a shared library exports symbols.
.sp
Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the
final program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to
be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake
will allow other targets to \(dqlink\(dq to the executable with the
\X'tty: link #command:target_link_libraries'\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP\X'tty: link' command.  On all platforms a target\-level
dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.
Handling of the executable on the link lines of the loadable modules
varies by platform:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
On Windows\-based systems (including Cygwin) an \(dqimport library\(dq is
created along with the executable to list the exported symbols.
Loadable modules link to the import library to get the symbols.
.IP \(bu 2
On macOS, loadable modules link to the executable itself using the
\fB\-bundle_loader\fP flag.
.IP \(bu 2
On AIX, a linker \(dqimport file\(dq is created along with the executable
to list the exported symbols for import when linking other targets.
Loadable modules link to the import file to get the symbols.
.IP \(bu 2
On other platforms, loadable modules are simply linked without
referencing the executable since the dynamic loader will
automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS'\fI\%CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP\X'tty: link' variable, if it is set when an
executable target is created.  If \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS'\fI\%CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP\X'tty: link'
is not set, the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS'\fI\%CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP\X'tty: link' variable is used to initialize
the property instead for backward compatibility reasons.
See below for alternative initialization behavior for shared library targets.
.sp
Added in version 3.27: To link with a shared library on macOS, or to a shared framework on any Apple
platform, a linker import file can be used instead of the actual shared
library. These linker import files are also known as text\-based stubs, and
they have a \fB\&.tbd\fP file extension.
.sp
The generation of these linker import files, as well as their consumption, is
controlled by this property. When this property is set to true on a shared
library target, CMake will generate a \fB\&.tbd\fP file for the library.
Other targets that link to the shared library target will then use this
\fB\&.tbd\fP file when linking rather than linking to the shared library binary.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For backward compatibility reasons, this property will be ignored if the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>'\fI\%XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_GENERATE_TEXT_BASED_STUBS\fP\X'tty: link'
target property or the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>'\fI\%CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_GENERATE_TEXT_BASED_STUBS\fP\X'tty: link'
variable is set to false.
.UNINDENT

For shared library targets, this property is initialized by the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_ENABLE_EXPORTS'\fI\%CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP\X'tty: link' variable, if it is set when
the target is created.

.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
.sp
Set this target property to a true (or false) value to exclude (or include)
the target from the \(dqall\(dq target of the containing directory and its
ancestors.  If excluded, running e.g. \fBmake\fP in the containing directory
or its ancestors will not build the target by default.
.sp
If this target property is not set then the target will be included in
the \(dqall\(dq target of the containing directory.  Furthermore, it will be
included in the \(dqall\(dq target of its ancestor directories unless the
\X'tty: link #prop_dir:EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL'\fI\%EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP\X'tty: link' directory property is set.
.sp
With \fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP set to false or not set at all, the target
will be brought up to date as part of doing a \fBmake install\fP or its
equivalent for the CMake generator being used.
.sp
If a target has \fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP set to true, it may still be listed
in an \X'tty: link #targets'\fI\%install(TARGETS)\fP\X'tty: link' command, but the user is responsible for
ensuring that the target\(aqs build artifacts are not missing or outdated when
an install is performed.
.sp
This property may use \(dqgenerator expressions\(dq with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&. See
the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual for available expressions.
.sp
Only the \(dqNinja Multi\-Config\(dq generator supports a property value that varies by
configuration.  For all other generators the value of this property must be the
same for all configurations.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD
.sp
Exclude target from \fBBuild Solution\fP\&.
.sp
This property is only used by Visual Studio generators.
When set to \fBTRUE\fP, the target will not be built when you press
\fBBuild Solution\fP\&.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration version of target exclusion from \fBBuild Solution\fP\&.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD'\fI\%EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  If the generic
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD'\fI\%EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD\fP\X'tty: link' is also set on a target,
\fBEXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG>\fP takes
precedence in configurations for which it has a value.
.SS EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE
.sp
Added in version 3.31.

.sp
Enable/Disable output of a build database for a target.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE'\fI\%CMAKE_EXPORT_BUILD_DATABASE\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP

.SS EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS
.sp
Added in version 3.20.

Enable/Disable output of compile commands during generation for a target.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS'\fI\%CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set when a target is created.
.SS EXPORT_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME

\X'tty: link #command:export'\fI\%export(EXPORT)\fP\X'tty: link'\&. This can be used to assign a package name to a
package that is built by CMake and exported, or to override the package in the
\X'tty: link #command:find_package'\fI\%find_package()\fP\X'tty: link' call that created the target.
.sp
This property is initialized by \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_EXPORT_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME'\fI\%CMAKE_EXPORT_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS EXPORT_NAME
.sp
Exported name for target files.
.sp
This sets the name for the \fBIMPORTED\fP target generated by the
\X'tty: link #export'\fI\%install(EXPORT)\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #command:export'\fI\%export()\fP\X'tty: link' commands.
If not set, the logical target name is used by default.
.SS EXPORT_NO_SYSTEM
.sp
Added in version 3.25.

.sp
This property affects the behavior of the \X'tty: link #export'\fI\%install(EXPORT)\fP\X'tty: link' and
\X'tty: link #command:export'\fI\%export()\fP\X'tty: link' commands when they install or export the target respectively.
When \fBEXPORT_NO_SYSTEM\fP is set to true, those commands generate an imported
target with \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SYSTEM'\fI\%SYSTEM\fP\X'tty: link' property set to false.
.sp
See the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED'\fI\%NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED\fP\X'tty: link' target property to set this
behavior on the target \fIconsuming\fP the include directories rather than the
one \fIproviding\fP them.
.SS EXPORT_PROPERTIES
.sp
Added in version 3.12.

.sp
List additional properties to export for a target.
.sp
This property contains a list of property names that should be exported by
the \X'tty: link #export'\fI\%install(EXPORT)\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #command:export'\fI\%export()\fP\X'tty: link' commands.  By default
only a limited number of properties are exported. This property can be used
to additionally export other properties as well.
.sp
Properties starting with \fBINTERFACE_\fP or \fBIMPORTED_\fP are not allowed as
they are reserved for internal CMake use.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Since CMake 3.19, \X'tty: link #interface-libraries'\fI\%Interface Libraries\fP\X'tty: link' may have arbitrary

with custom properties, the resulting package may not work with
dependents configured by older versions of CMake that reject the
custom properties.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS FOLDER
.sp
For IDEs that present targets using a folder hierarchy, this property
specifies the name of the folder to place the target under.
To nest folders, use \fBFOLDER\fP values such as \fBGUI/Dialogs\fP with \fB/\fP
characters separating folder levels.  Targets with no \fBFOLDER\fP property
will appear as top level entities.  Targets with the same \fBFOLDER\fP
property value will appear in the same folder as siblings.
.sp
Only some CMake generators honor the \fBFOLDER\fP property
(e.g. \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' or any of the
\X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio\fP\X'tty: link' generators).
Those generators that don\(aqt will simply ignore it.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_FOLDER'\fI\%CMAKE_FOLDER\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
The global property \X'tty: link #prop_gbl:USE_FOLDERS'\fI\%USE_FOLDERS\fP\X'tty: link' must be set to true, otherwise
the \fBFOLDER\fP property is ignored.
.SS Fortran_BUILDING_INSTRINSIC_MODULES
.sp
Added in version 3.22.

.sp
Instructs the CMake Fortran preprocessor that the target is building
Fortran intrinsics for building a Fortran compiler.
.sp
This property is off by default and should be turned only on projects
that build a Fortran compiler. It should not be turned on for projects
that use a Fortran compiler.
.sp
Turning this property on will correctly add dependencies for building
Fortran intrinsic modules whereas turning the property off will ignore
Fortran intrinsic modules in the dependency graph as they are supplied
by the compiler itself.
.SS Fortran_FORMAT
.sp
Set to \fBFIXED\fP or \fBFREE\fP to indicate the Fortran source layout.
.sp
This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source files in a target
use fixed\-format or free\-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding
format flag to the compiler.  Use the source\-specific \fBFortran_FORMAT\fP
property to change the format of a specific source file.  If the
variable \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT'\fI\%CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT\fP\X'tty: link' is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.
.SS Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
.sp
Specify output directory for Fortran modules provided by the target.
.sp
If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules and
the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies the
directory in which the modules will be placed.  When this property is
not set the modules will be placed in the build directory
corresponding to the target\(aqs source directory.  If the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY'\fI\%CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY\fP\X'tty: link' is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.
.sp
When using one of the \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link' with the Intel Fortran
plugin installed in Visual Studio, a subdirectory named after the
configuration will be appended to the path where modules are created.
For example, if \fBFortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY\fP is set to \fBC:/some/path\fP,
modules will end up in \fBC:/some/path/Debug\fP (or
\fBC:/some/path/Release\fP etc.) when an Intel Fortran \fB\&.vfproj\fP file is
generated, and in \fBC:/some/path\fP when any other generator is used.
.sp
Note that some compilers will automatically search the module output
directory for modules USEd during compilation but others will not.  If
your sources USE modules their location must be specified by
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' regardless of this property.
.SS Fortran_PREPROCESS
.sp
Added in version 3.18.

.sp
Control whether the Fortran source file should be unconditionally
preprocessed.
.sp
If unset or empty, rely on the compiler to determine whether the file
should be preprocessed. If explicitly set to \fBOFF\fP then the file does not
need to be preprocessed. If explicitly set to \fBON\fP, then the file does
need to be preprocessed as part of the compilation step.
.sp
When using the \X'tty: link #generator:Ninja'\fI\%Ninja\fP\X'tty: link' generator, all source files are
first preprocessed in order to generate module dependency
information. Setting this property to \fBOFF\fP will make \fBNinja\fP

.SS FRAMEWORK
.sp
Build \fBSHARED\fP or \fBSTATIC\fP library as Framework Bundle on the macOS and iOS.
.sp
If such a library target has this property set to \fBTRUE\fP it will be
built as a framework when built on the macOS and iOS.  It will have the
directory structure required for a framework and will be suitable to
be used with the \fB\-framework\fP option.  This property is initialized by the

Added in version 3.18.

.sp
Postfix to append to the framework file name for configuration \fB<CONFIG>\fP,
when using a multi\-config generator (like Xcode and Ninja Multi\-Config).
.sp
When building with configuration \fB<CONFIG>\fP the value of this property
is appended to the framework file name built on disk.
.sp
For example, given a framework called \fBmy_fw\fP, a value of \fB_debug\fP
for the \fBFRAMEWORK_MULTI_CONFIG_POSTFIX_DEBUG\fP property, and
\fBDebug;Release\fP in \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES'\fI\%CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES\fP\X'tty: link', the following

Added in version 3.4.

.sp
Version of a framework created using the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FRAMEWORK'\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link' target
property (e.g. \fBA\fP).
.sp
This property only affects macOS, as iOS doesn\(aqt have versioned

.SS GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
.sp
Generator\(aqs file for this target.
.sp
An internal property used by some generators to record the name of the

\X'tty: link #command:include_external_msproject'\fI\%include_external_msproject()\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS GHS_INTEGRITY_APP
.sp
Added in version 3.14.

.sp
\fBON\fP / \fBOFF\fP boolean to determine if an executable target should
be treated as an \fIIntegrity Application\fP\&.
.sp
If no value is set and if a \fB\&.int\fP file is added as a source file to the
executable target it will be treated as an \fIIntegrity Application\fP\&.
.sp
Supported on \X'tty: link #generator:Green Hills MULTI'\fI\%Green Hills MULTI\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE
.sp
Added in version 3.14.

.sp
\fBON\fP / \fBOFF\fP boolean to control if the project file for a target should
be one single file or multiple files.
.sp
The default behavior or when the property is \fBOFF\fP is to generate a project
file for the target and then a sub\-project file for each source group.
.sp
When this property is \fBON\fP or if \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE'\fI\%CMAKE_GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE\fP\X'tty: link'
is \fBON\fP then only a single project file is generated for the target.
.sp

.SS GNUtoMS
.sp
Convert GNU import library (\fB\&.dll.a\fP) to MS format (\fB\&.lib\fP).
.sp
When linking a shared library or executable that exports symbols using
GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual Studio installed convert
the import library (\fB\&.dll.a\fP) from GNU to MS format (\fB\&.lib\fP).  Both import
libraries will be installed by \X'tty: link #targets'\fI\%install(TARGETS)\fP\X'tty: link' and exported by
\X'tty: link #export'\fI\%install(EXPORT)\fP\X'tty: link' and  \X'tty: link #command:export'\fI\%export()\fP\X'tty: link' to be linked
by applications with either GNU\- or MS\-compatible tools.
.sp
If the variable \fBCMAKE_GNUtoMS\fP is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.  The variable must be set
prior to the first command that enables a language such as \X'tty: link #command:project'\fI\%project()\fP\X'tty: link'
or \X'tty: link #command:enable_language'\fI\%enable_language()\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  CMake provides the variable as an option to the
user automatically when configuring on Windows with GNU tools.
.SS HAS_CXX
.sp
Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obsolete).
.sp
This is equivalent to setting the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINKER_LANGUAGE'\fI\%LINKER_LANGUAGE\fP\X'tty: link'
property to \fBCXX\fP\&.
.SS HEADER_DIRS

.SS HEADER_SETS
.sp
Added in version 3.23.

.sp
Read\-only list of the target\(aqs \fBPRIVATE\fP and \fBPUBLIC\fP header sets (i.e.
all file sets with the type \fBHEADERS\fP). Files listed in these file sets are
treated as source files for the purpose of IDE integration. The files also
have their \X'tty: link #prop_sf:HEADER_FILE_ONLY'\fI\%HEADER_FILE_ONLY\fP\X'tty: link' property set to \fBTRUE\fP\&.
.sp
Header sets may be defined using the \X'tty: link #command:target_sources'\fI\%target_sources()\fP\X'tty: link' command
\fBFILE_SET\fP option with type \fBHEADERS\fP\&.

.sp
List of GPU architectures to for which to generate device code.
Architecture names are interpreted based on \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_HIP_PLATFORM'\fI\%CMAKE_HIP_PLATFORM\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
A non\-empty false value (e.g. \fBOFF\fP) disables adding architectures.
This is intended to support packagers and rare cases where full control
over the passed flags is required.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES'\fI\%CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES\fP\X'tty: link'
variable if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
The HIP compilation model has two modes: whole and separable. Whole compilation
generates device code at compile time. Separable compilation generates device
code at link time. Therefore the \fBHIP_ARCHITECTURES\fP target property should
be set on targets that compile or link with any HIP sources.

.SS HIP_EXTENSIONS
.sp
Added in version 3.21.

.sp
Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.
.sp
This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP instead of \fB\-std=c++11\fP to the compile line.  This
property is \fBON\fP by default. The basic HIP/C++ standard level is
controlled by the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:HIP_STANDARD'\fI\%HIP_STANDARD\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.sp
See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-compile-features(7)'\fI\%cmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual for information on

.SS IMPORTED_CXX_MODULES_COMPILE_OPTIONS
.sp
Added in version 3.28.

.sp
List of options to pass to the compiler for this \fBIMPORTED\fP target\(aqs C++

.SS Option De\-duplication
.sp
The final set of options used for a target is constructed by
accumulating options from the current target and the usage requirements of
its dependencies.  The set of options is de\-duplicated to avoid repetition.
.sp
Added in version 3.12: While beneficial for individual options, the de\-duplication step can break
up option groups.  For example, \fB\-option A \-option B\fP becomes
\fB\-option A B\fP\&.  One may specify a group of options using shell\-like
quoting along with a \fBSHELL:\fP prefix.  The \fBSHELL:\fP prefix is dropped,
and the rest of the option string is parsed using the
\X'tty: link #command:separate_arguments'\fI\%separate_arguments()\fP\X'tty: link' \fBUNIX_COMMAND\fP mode. For example,
\fB\(dqSHELL:\-option A\(dq \(dqSHELL:\-option B\(dq\fP becomes \fB\-option A \-option B\fP\&.

.sp
The boolean value of this property is True for targets created with the
\fBIMPORTED\fP \fBGLOBAL\fP options to \X'tty: link #command:add_executable'\fI\%add_executable()\fP\X'tty: link' or
\X'tty: link #command:add_library'\fI\%add_library()\fP\X'tty: link'\&. It is always False for targets built within the

\fBIMPORTED_IMPLIB\fP to be set.

.sp
The \fBIMPORTED_IMPLIB\fP target property may be overridden for a
given configuration \fB<CONFIG>\fP by the configuration\-specific
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>'\fI\%IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' target property.  Furthermore,
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>'\fI\%MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' target property may be
used to map between a project\(aqs configurations and those of an imported
target.  If none of these is set then the name of any other configuration
listed in the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS'\fI\%IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS\fP\X'tty: link' target property may be
selected and its \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>'\fI\%IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' value used.
.sp
This property is ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_IMPLIB'\fI\%IMPORTED_IMPLIB\fP\X'tty: link' property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_LIBNAME
.sp
Added in version 3.8.

.sp
Specify the link library name for an \X'tty: link #imported-targets'\fI\%imported\fP\X'tty: link'
\X'tty: link #interface-libraries'\fI\%Interface Library\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
An interface library builds no library file itself but does specify
usage requirements for its consumers.  The \fBIMPORTED_LIBNAME\fP
property may be set to specify a single library name to be placed
on the link line in place of the interface library target name as
a requirement for using the interface.
.sp
This property is intended for use in naming libraries provided by
a platform SDK for which the full path to a library file may not
be known.  The value may be a plain library name such as \fBfoo\fP
but may \fInot\fP be a path (e.g. \fB/usr/lib/libfoo.so\fP) or a flag
(e.g. \fB\-Wl,...\fP).  The name is never treated as a library target
name even if it happens to name one.
.sp
The \fBIMPORTED_LIBNAME\fP property is allowed only on
\X'tty: link #imported-targets'\fI\%imported\fP\X'tty: link' \X'tty: link #interface-libraries'\fI\%Interface Libraries\fP\X'tty: link'
and is rejected on targets of other types (for which
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LOCATION'\fI\%IMPORTED_LOCATION\fP\X'tty: link' target property may be used).
.SS IMPORTED_LIBNAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
Added in version 3.8.

.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LIBNAME'\fI\%IMPORTED_LIBNAME\fP\X'tty: link' property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
.sp
Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.
.sp
Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of
their implementation.  On some platforms the linker searches for the
dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including in the
link.  Set this property to the list of dependent shared libraries of
an imported library.  The list should be disjoint from the list of
interface libraries in the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' property.  On
platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link
time CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the
link command line.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES'\fI\%IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES
.sp
Languages compiled into an \fBIMPORTED\fP static library.
.sp
Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to produce
a \fBSTATIC IMPORTED\fP library (such as \fBC\fP or \fBCXX\fP).  CMake accounts for
these languages when computing how to link a target to the imported
library.  For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++
static library CMake chooses the C++ linker to satisfy language
runtime dependencies of the static library.
.sp
This property is ignored for targets that are not \fBSTATIC\fP libraries.
This property is ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES'\fI\%IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
.sp
Transitive link interface of an \fBIMPORTED\fP target.
.sp
Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is included when an
\fBIMPORTED\fP library target is linked to another target.  The libraries
will be included on the link line for the target.  Unlike the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES'\fI\%LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' property, this property applies to all
imported target types, including \fBSTATIC\fP libraries.  This property is
ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
This property is ignored if the target also has a non\-empty
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' property.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' instead.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES'\fI\%IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.sp
This property is ignored if the target also has a non\-empty
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' property.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' instead.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
.sp
Repetition count for cycles of \fBIMPORTED\fP static libraries.
.sp
This is \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY'\fI\%LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY\fP\X'tty: link' for \fBIMPORTED\fP targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY'\fI\%IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for
the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LOCATION
.sp
Full path to the main file on disk for an \fBIMPORTED\fP target.
.sp
Set this to the location of an \fBIMPORTED\fP target file on disk.  For
executables this is the location of the executable file.  For \fBSTATIC\fP
libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module.
For \fBSHARED\fP libraries on non\-DLL platforms this is the location of the
shared library.  For application bundles on macOS this is the location of
the executable file inside \fBContents/MacOS\fP within the bundle folder.
For frameworks on macOS this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this
is the location of the \fB\&.dll\fP part of the library.  For \fBUNKNOWN\fP
libraries this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for
non\-imported targets.
.sp
Added in version 3.28: For ordinary frameworks on Apple platforms, this may be the location of the
\fB\&.framework\fP folder itself.  For XCFrameworks, it may be the location of
the \fB\&.xcframework\fP folder, in which case any target that links against it
will get the selected library\(aqs \fBHeaders\fP directory as a usage requirement.

.sp
The \fBIMPORTED_LOCATION\fP target property may be overridden for a
given configuration \fB<CONFIG>\fP by the configuration\-specific
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>'\fI\%IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' target property.  Furthermore,
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>'\fI\%MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' target property may be
used to map between a project\(aqs configurations and those of an imported
target.  If none of these is set then the name of any other configuration
listed in the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS'\fI\%IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS\fP\X'tty: link' target property may be
selected and its \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>'\fI\%IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' value used.
.sp
To get the location of an imported target read one of the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LOCATION'\fI\%LOCATION\fP\X'tty: link'
or \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LOCATION_<CONFIG>'\fI\%LOCATION_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' properties.
.sp
For platforms with import libraries (e.g. Windows, AIX or Apple) see also
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_IMPLIB'\fI\%IMPORTED_IMPLIB\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LOCATION'\fI\%IMPORTED_LOCATION\fP\X'tty: link' property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
.sp
Specifies that an \fBIMPORTED\fP shared library target has no \fBsoname\fP\&.
.sp
Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that has
no \fBsoname\fP field.  CMake may adjust generated link commands for some
platforms to prevent the linker from using the path to the library in
place of its missing \fBsoname\fP\&.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_NO_SONAME'\fI\%IMPORTED_NO_SONAME\fP\X'tty: link' property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_OBJECTS
.sp
Added in version 3.9.

.sp
A \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of absolute paths
to the object files on disk for an \X'tty: link #imported-targets'\fI\%imported\fP\X'tty: link'
\X'tty: link #object-libraries'\fI\%object library\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
Projects may skip \fBIMPORTED_OBJECTS\fP if the configuration\-specific
property \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>'\fI\%IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' is set instead, except in
situations as noted in the section below.
.SS Xcode Generator Considerations
.sp
Added in version 3.20.

.sp
For Apple platforms, a project may be built for more than one architecture.
This is controlled by the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES'\fI\%CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP\X'tty: link' variable.
For all but the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' generator, CMake invokes compilers once
per source file and passes multiple \fB\-arch\fP flags, leading to a single
object file which will be a universal binary.  Such object files work well
when listed in the \fBIMPORTED_OBJECTS\fP of a separate CMake build, even for
the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' generator.  But producing such object files with the
\X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' generator is more difficult, since it invokes the compiler
once per architecture for each source file.  Unlike the other generators,
it does not generate universal object file binaries.
.sp
A further complication with the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' generator is that when
targeting device platforms (iOS, tvOS, visionOS or watchOS), the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link'
generator has the ability to use either the device or simulator SDK without
needing CMake to be re\-run.  The SDK can be selected at build time.
But since some architectures can be supported by both the device and the
simulator SDKs (e.g. \fBarm64\fP with Xcode 12 or later), not all combinations
can be represented in a single universal binary.  The only solution in this
case is to have multiple object files.
.sp
\fBIMPORTED_OBJECTS\fP doesn\(aqt support generator expressions, so every file
it lists needs to be valid for every architecture and SDK.  If incorporating
object files that are not universal binaries, the path and/or file name of
each object file has to somehow encapsulate the different architectures and
SDKs.  With the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' generator, Xcode variables of the form
\fB$(...)\fP can be used to represent these aspects and Xcode will substitute
the appropriate values at build time.  CMake doesn\(aqt interpret these
variables and embeds them unchanged in the Xcode project file.
\fB$(CURRENT_ARCH)\fP can be used to represent the architecture, while
\fB$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)\fP can be used to differentiate between SDKs.
.sp
The following shows one example of how these two variables can be used to
refer to an object file whose location depends on both the SDK and the
architecture:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(someObjs OBJECT IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET someObjs PROPERTY IMPORTED_OBJECTS
  # Quotes are required because of the ()
  \(dq/path/to/somewhere/objects$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)/$(CURRENT_ARCH)/func.o\(dq
)

# Example paths:
#   /path/to/somewhere/objects\-iphoneos/arm64/func.o
#   /path/to/somewhere/objects\-iphonesimulator/x86_64/func.o
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In some cases, you may want to have configuration\-specific object files
as well.  The \fB$(CONFIGURATION)\fP Xcode variable is often used for this and
can be used in conjunction with the others mentioned above:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(someObjs OBJECT IMPORTED)
set_property(TARGET someObjs PROPERTY IMPORTED_OBJECTS
  \(dq/path/to/somewhere/$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)/$(CURRENT_ARCH)/func.o\(dq
)

# Example paths:
#   /path/to/somewhere/Release\-iphoneos/arm64/func.o
#   /path/to/somewhere/Debug\-iphonesimulator/x86_64/func.o
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When any Xcode variable is used, CMake is not able to fully evaluate the
path(s) at configure time.  One consequence of this is that the
configuration\-specific \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>'\fI\%IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' properties cannot
be used, since CMake cannot determine whether an object file exists at a
particular \fB<CONFIG>\fP location.  The \fBIMPORTED_OBJECTS\fP property must be
used for these situations and the configuration\-specific aspects of the path
should be handled by the \fB$(CONFIGURATION)\fP Xcode variable.
.SS IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>
.sp
Added in version 3.9.

.sp
\fB<CONFIG>\fP\-specific version of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_OBJECTS'\fI\%IMPORTED_OBJECTS\fP\X'tty: link' property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS Xcode Generator Considerations
.sp
Do not use this \fB<CONFIG>\fP\-specific property if you need to use Xcode
variables like \fB$(CURRENT_ARCH)\fP or \fB$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)\fP in
the value.  The \fB<CONFIG>\fP\-specific properties will be ignored in such
cases because CMake cannot determine whether a file exists at the
configuration\-specific path at configuration time.  For such cases, use
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_OBJECTS'\fI\%IMPORTED_OBJECTS\fP\X'tty: link' instead.
.SS IMPORTED_SONAME
.sp
The \fBsoname\fP of an \fBIMPORTED\fP target of shared library type.
.sp
Set this to the \fBsoname\fP embedded in an imported shared library.  This
is meaningful only on platforms supporting the feature.  Ignored for
non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_SONAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_SONAME'\fI\%IMPORTED_SONAME\fP\X'tty: link' property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORT_PREFIX
.sp
What comes before the import library name.
.sp
Similar to the target property \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:PREFIX'\fI\%PREFIX\fP\X'tty: link', but used for import libraries
(typically corresponding to a \fBDLL\fP) instead of regular libraries.  A
target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as \fBlib\fP)
on an import library name.
.SS IMPORT_SUFFIX
.sp
What comes after the import library name.
.sp
Similar to the target property \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SUFFIX'\fI\%SUFFIX\fP\X'tty: link', but used
for import libraries (typically corresponding to a \fBDLL\fP) instead of
regular libraries.  A target property that can be set to override
the suffix (such as \fB\&.lib\fP) on an import library name.
.SS INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of preprocessor include file search directories.
.sp
This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
\X'tty: link #command:target_include_directories'\fI\%target_include_directories()\fP\X'tty: link' command.  In addition to accepting
values from that command, values may be set directly on any
target using the \X'tty: link #command:set_property'\fI\%set_property()\fP\X'tty: link' command.  A target gets its
initial value for this property from the value of the
\X'tty: link #prop_dir:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' directory property.  Both directory and
target property values are adjusted by calls to the
\X'tty: link #command:include_directories'\fI\%include_directories()\fP\X'tty: link' command.
.sp
The value of this property is used by the generators to set the include
paths for the compiler.
.sp
Relative paths should not be added to this property directly. Use one of
the commands above instead to handle relative paths.
.sp
Contents of \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP\X'tty: link' with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP\X'tty: link'
manual for available expressions.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-buildsystem(7)'\fI\%cmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP\X'tty: link'
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INSTALL_NAME_DIR
.sp
Directory name for installed targets on Apple platforms.
.sp
\fBINSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP is a string specifying the directory portion of the
\(dqinstall_name\(dq field of shared libraries on Apple platforms for
installed targets.  When not set, the default directory used is determined
by \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACOSX_RPATH'\fI\%MACOSX_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  If the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR'\fI\%BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\X'tty: link'
property is set, this will be used already in the build tree.
Policies \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0068'\fI\%CMP0068\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0042'\fI\%CMP0042\fP\X'tty: link' are also relevant.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR'\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
This property supports \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
In particular, the \X'tty: link #genex:INSTALL_PREFIX'\fI\%$<INSTALL_PREFIX>\fP\X'tty: link' generator expression can be
used to set the directory relative to the install\-time prefix.
.sp
On platforms that support runtime paths (\fBRPATH\fP), refer to the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_RPATH'\fI\%INSTALL_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
Under Windows, the \X'tty: link #genex:TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS'\fI\%TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS\fP\X'tty: link' generator expression is related.
.SS INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH
.sp
Added in version 3.16.

.sp
Controls whether toolchain\-defined rpaths should be removed during installation.
.sp
When a target is being installed, CMake may need to rewrite its rpath
information.  This occurs when the install rpath (as specified by the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_RPATH'\fI\%INSTALL_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' target property) has different contents to the rpath
that the target was built with.  Some toolchains insert their own rpath
contents into the binary as part of the build.  By default, CMake will
preserve those extra inserted contents in the install rpath.  For those
scenarios where such toolchain\-inserted entries need to be discarded during
install, set the \fBINSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH\fP target property to true.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH'\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' when the target is created.
.SS INSTALL_RPATH
.sp
The rpath to use for installed targets.
.sp
By default, the install rpath is empty. It can be set using this property,
which is a semicolon\-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed
targets (for platforms that support it).  This property is initialized
by the value of the variable \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH'\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set
when a target is created.
Beside setting the install rpath manually, using the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH'\fI\%INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH\fP\X'tty: link' target property it can also be
generated automatically by CMake.
.sp
Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables
etc on systems that use RPATH, see the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUILD_RPATH'\fI\%BUILD_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' target
property. When the software is installed
the targets are edited (or relinked) by CMake (see
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH'\fI\%CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH\fP\X'tty: link') to have the install RPATH.
This editing during installation can be avoided via
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH'\fI\%BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.sp
For handling toolchain\-dependent RPATH entries the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH'\fI\%INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' can be used.
Runtime paths can be disabled completely via the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH'\fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link'
variable.
.sp
Because the rpath may contain \fB${ORIGIN}\fP, which coincides with CMake syntax,
the contents of \fBINSTALL_RPATH\fP are properly escaped in the
\fBcmake_install.cmake\fP script (see policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0095'\fI\%CMP0095\fP\X'tty: link'\&.)
.sp
This property supports
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
On Apple platforms, refer to the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_NAME_DIR'\fI\%INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
Under Windows, the \X'tty: link #genex:TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS'\fI\%TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS\fP\X'tty: link' generator expression is related.
.SS INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
.sp
Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.
.sp
\fBINSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH\fP is a boolean that if set to \fBTRUE\fP
will append to the runtime search path (rpath) of installed binaries
any directories outside the project that are in the linker search path or
contain linked library files.  The directories are appended after the
value of the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_RPATH'\fI\%INSTALL_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH'\fI\%CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set when a target is
created.
.SS INTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES
.sp
Added in version 3.27.

.sp
A \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of macro names for
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link' to be propagated to consumers.
.sp
When a target with \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link' enabled links to a library that sets
\fBINTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES\fP, the target inherits the listed macro names
and merges them with those specified in its own \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES'\fI\%AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES\fP\X'tty: link'
property.  The target will then automatically generate MOC files for source
files that contain the inherited macro names too, not just the macro names
specified in its own \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES'\fI\%AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES\fP\X'tty: link' property.
.sp
By default \fBINTERFACE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES\fP is empty.
.sp
See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-qt(7)'\fI\%cmake\-qt(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS Example 1
.sp
In this example, \fBmyapp\fP inherits the macro names \fBSTATIC_LIB_1\fP and
\fBSTATIC_LIB_2\fP from \fBstatic_lib\fP\&.  The \fBmoc\fP tool will then automatically
be run on any of the \fBmyapp\fP sources which contain \fBSTATIC_LIB_1\fP or
\fBSTATIC_LIB_2\fP\&.

implementation of the plugin depends on \fBFoo\fP and other things.
In this case, the application should link to \fBFooPlugin\fP directly,
before \fBFoo\fP\&.  However, the application author only knows about \fBFoo\fP\&.
We can express this as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Core library used by other components.
add_library(Core STATIC core.cpp)

# Foo is a static library for use by applications.
# Implementation of Foo depends on Core.
add_library(Foo STATIC foo.cpp foo_plugin_helper.cpp)
target_link_libraries(Foo PRIVATE Core)

# Extra parts of Foo for use by its static plugins.
# Implementation of Foo\(aqs extra parts depends on both Core and Foo.
add_library(FooExtras STATIC foo_extras.cpp)
target_link_libraries(FooExtras PRIVATE Core Foo)

# The Foo library has an associated static plugin
# that should be linked into the final executable.
# Implementation of the plugin depends on Core, Foo, and FooExtras.
add_library(FooPlugin STATIC foo_plugin.cpp)
target_link_libraries(FooPlugin PRIVATE Core Foo FooExtras)

# An app that links Foo should link Foo\(aqs plugin directly.
set_property(TARGET Foo PROPERTY INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT FooPlugin)

# An app does not need to link Foo directly because the plugin links it.
set_property(TARGET Foo PROPERTY INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE Foo)

An application \fBapp\fP only needs to specify that it links to \fBFoo\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_executable(app main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE Foo)
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT\fP target property on \fBFoo\fP tells
CMake to pretend that \fBapp\fP also links directly to \fBFooPlugin\fP\&.
The \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE\fP target property on \fBFoo\fP
tells CMake to pretend that \fBapp\fP did \fInot\fP link directly to \fBFoo\fP\&.
Instead, \fBFoo\fP will be linked as a dependency of \fBFooPlugin\fP\&.  The
final link line for \fBapp\fP will link the libraries in the following
order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFooPlugin\fP as a direct link dependency of \fBapp\fP
(via \fBFoo\fP\(aqs usage requirements).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFooExtras\fP as a dependency of \fBFooPlugin\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFoo\fP as a dependency of \fBFooPlugin\fP and \fBFooExtras\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCore\fP as a dependency of \fBFooPlugin\fP, \fBFooExtras\fP, and \fBFoo\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that without the \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE\fP target
property, \fBFoo\fP would be linked twice: once as a direct dependency
of \fBapp\fP, and once as a dependency of \fBFooPlugin\fP\&.
.SS Example: Opt\-In Static Plugins
.sp
In the above \fI\%Example: Static Plugins\fP, the \fBapp\fP executable specifies
that it links directly to \fBFoo\fP\&.  In a real application, there might
be an intermediate library:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(app_impl STATIC app_impl.cpp)
target_link_libraries(app_impl PRIVATE Foo)

add_executable(app main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE app_impl)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case we do not want \fBFoo\fP\(aqs \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT\fP
and \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE\fP target properties to affect
the direct dependencies of \fBapp_impl\fP\&.  To avoid this, we can revise
the property values to make their effects opt\-in:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# An app that links Foo should link Foo\(aqs plugin directly.
set_property(TARGET Foo PROPERTY INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT
  \(dq$<$<BOOL:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:FOO_STATIC_PLUGINS>>:FooPlugin>\(dq

# An app does not need to link Foo directly because the plugin links it.
set_property(TARGET Foo PROPERTY INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE
  \(dq$<$<BOOL:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:FOO_STATIC_PLUGINS>>:Foo>\(dq
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now, the \fBapp\fP executable can opt\-in to get \fBFoo\fP\(aqs plugin(s):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_property(TARGET app PROPERTY FOO_STATIC_PLUGINS 1)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

The final link line for \fBapp\fP will now link the libraries in the following

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFooPlugin\fP as a direct link dependency of \fBapp\fP
(via \fBFoo\fP\(aqs usage requirements).

.SS INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE
.sp
Added in version 3.24.

.sp
List of libraries that consumers of this library should \fInot\fP treat
as direct link dependencies.
.sp
This target property may be set to \fIexclude\fP items from a dependent
target\(aqs final set of direct link dependencies.  This property is
processed after the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT'\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT\fP\X'tty: link'
target property of all other dependencies of the dependent target, so
exclusion from direct link dependence takes priority over inclusion.
.sp
The initial set of a dependent target\(aqs direct link dependencies is
specified by its \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' target property.  Indirect
link dependencies are specified by the transitive closure of the direct
link dependencies\(aq \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' properties.
Any link dependency may specify additional direct link dependencies
using the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT'\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
The set of direct link dependencies is then filtered to exclude items named
by any dependency\(aqs \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE\fP target
property.
.sp
Excluding an item from a dependent target\(aqs direct link dependencies
does not mean the dependent target won\(aqt link the item.  The item
may still be linked as an indirect link dependency via the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' property on other dependencies.
.sp
The value of \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES_DIRECT_EXCLUDE\fP may use

.SS INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS
.sp
Added in version 3.13.

.sp
List of public link options requirements for a library.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the link options
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The \X'tty: link #command:target_link_options'\fI\%target_link_options()\fP\X'tty: link'
command populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \X'tty: link #command:target_link_libraries'\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP\X'tty: link',
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS\fP may use \(dqgenerator expressions\(dq
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP\X'tty: link'

\-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
.sp
Whether consumers need to create a position\-independent target
.sp
The \fBINTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP property informs consumers of
this target whether they must set their
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE'\fI\%POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP\X'tty: link' property to \fBON\fP\&.  If this
property is set to \fBON\fP, then the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE'\fI\%POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP\X'tty: link'
property on  all consumers will be set to \fBON\fP\&. Similarly, if this
property is set to \fBOFF\fP, then the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE'\fI\%POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP\X'tty: link'
property on all consumers will be set to \fBOFF\fP\&.  If this property is
undefined, then consumers will determine their
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE'\fI\%POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP\X'tty: link' property by other means.  Consumers
must ensure that the targets that they link to have a consistent
requirement for their \fBINTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP property.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP may use
\(dqgenerator expressions\(dq with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual for available expressions.

.SS INTERFACE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS
.sp
Added in version 3.16.

.sp
List of interface header files to precompile into consuming targets.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the header files
for consuming targets to precompile.  The \X'tty: link #command:target_precompile_headers'\fI\%target_precompile_headers()\fP\X'tty: link'
command populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.
See the discussion in \X'tty: link #command:target_precompile_headers'\fI\%target_precompile_headers()\fP\X'tty: link' for guidance on
appropriate use of this property for installed or exported targets.

manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INTERFACE_SOURCES
.sp
Added in version 3.1.

.sp
List of interface sources to compile into consuming targets.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the sources
for consuming targets to compile.  The \X'tty: link #command:target_sources'\fI\%target_sources()\fP\X'tty: link' command
populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \X'tty: link #command:target_link_libraries'\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP\X'tty: link',
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
sources of the consumer.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_SOURCES\fP may use \(dqgenerator expressions\(dq

manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of public system include directories for a library.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories
which contain system headers, and therefore should not result in
compiler warnings.  Additionally, system include directories are searched
after normal include directories regardless of the order specified.
.sp
When the \X'tty: link #command:target_include_directories'\fI\%target_include_directories()\fP\X'tty: link' command is given the
\fBSYSTEM\fP keyword, it populates this property with values provided after the
\fBPUBLIC\fP and \fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.
.sp
Projects may also get and set the property directly, but must be aware that
adding directories to this property does not make those directories used
during compilation.  Adding directories to this property marks directories
as system directories which otherwise would be used in a non\-system manner.
This can appear similar to duplication, so prefer the high\-level
\X'tty: link #command:target_include_directories'\fI\%target_include_directories()\fP\X'tty: link' command with the \fBSYSTEM\fP keyword
and avoid setting the property directly.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \X'tty: link #command:target_link_libraries'\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP\X'tty: link',
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to mark the
same include directories as containing system headers.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use \(dqgenerator
expressions\(dq with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual for available expressions.

Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.
.sp
If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
known \X'tty: link #module:CheckIPOSupported'\fI\%to be supported\fP\X'tty: link' by the compiler. Depending
on value of policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0069'\fI\%CMP0069\fP\X'tty: link', the error will be reported or ignored,
if interprocedural optimization is enabled but not supported.
.sp
This property is initialized by the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION'\fI\%CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set when a
target is created.
.sp
There is also the per\-configuration \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>'\fI\%INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link'
target property, which overrides \fI\%INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION\fP
if it is set.
.SS INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.
.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION'\fI\%INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named

.SS ISPC_HEADER_DIRECTORY
.sp
Added in version 3.19.

.sp
Specify relative output directory for ISPC headers provided by the target.
.sp
If the target contains ISPC source files, this specifies the directory in which
the generated headers will be placed. Relative paths are treated with respect to
the value of \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR'\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP\X'tty: link'\&. When this property is not set, the
headers will be placed a generator defined build directory. If the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_ISPC_HEADER_DIRECTORY'\fI\%CMAKE_ISPC_HEADER_DIRECTORY\fP\X'tty: link' is set when a target is created
its value is used to initialize this property.
.SS ISPC_HEADER_SUFFIX
.sp
Added in version 3.19.2.

.sp
Specify output suffix to be used for ISPC generated headers provided by the target.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_ISPC_HEADER_SUFFIX'\fI\%CMAKE_ISPC_HEADER_SUFFIX\fP\X'tty: link'
variable if it is set when a target  is created.
.sp
If the target contains ISPC source files, this specifies the header suffix to
be used for the generated headers.
.sp
The default value is \fB_ispc.h\fP\&.
.SS ISPC_INSTRUCTION_SETS

This property is initialized by the value of the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_ISPC_INSTRUCTION_SETS'\fI\%CMAKE_ISPC_INSTRUCTION_SETS\fP\X'tty: link'
variable if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
The \fBISPC_INSTRUCTION_SETS\fP target property must be used when generating for multiple

.sp
When this property is set, CMake takes ownership of the specified directory,

at any time during configure or build time. Users should use a dedicated
directory for exporting clang\-tidy fixes to avoid having files deleted or
overwritten by CMake. Users should not create, modify, or delete files in this

Do not depend on linked shared library files.
.sp
Set this property to true to tell CMake generators not to add
file\-level dependencies on the shared library files linked by this
target.  Modification to the shared libraries will not be sufficient
to re\-link this target.  Logical target\-level dependencies will not be
affected so the linked shared libraries will still be brought up to

.SS LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
.sp
List public interface libraries for a shared library or executable.

By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to
targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an executable
with exports (see the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:ENABLE_EXPORTS'\fI\%ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP\X'tty: link' target property) no
default transitive link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the default
transitive link dependencies with an explicit list.  When the target
is linked into another target using the \X'tty: link #command:target_link_libraries'\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP\X'tty: link'
command, the libraries listed (and recursively
their link interface libraries) will be provided to the other target
also.  If the list is empty then no transitive link dependencies will
be incorporated when this target is linked into another target even if
the default set is non\-empty.  This property is initialized by the
value of the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES'\fI\%CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is
set when a target is created.  This property is ignored for \fBSTATIC\fP

.SS LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
.sp
Repetition count for \fBSTATIC\fP libraries with cyclic dependencies.
.sp
When linking to a \fBSTATIC\fP library target with cyclic dependencies the
linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the
strongly connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by
default constructs the link line so that the linker will scan through
the component at least twice.  This property specifies the minimum
number of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake uses the
largest value specified by any target in a component.
.SS LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>

.SS LINK_LIBRARIES_STRATEGY
.sp
Added in version 3.31.

.sp
Specify a strategy for ordering a target\(aqs direct link dependencies
on linker command lines.  This property is initialized by the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_STRATEGY'\fI\%CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_STRATEGY\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set when a
target is created.
.sp
CMake generates a target\(aqs link line using its \X'tty: link #target-link-properties'\fI\%Target Link Properties\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
In particular, the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' target property records the
target\(aqs direct link dependencies, typically populated by calls to
\X'tty: link #command:target_link_libraries'\fI\%target_link_libraries()\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  Indirect link dependencies are
propagated from those entries of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' that name
library targets by following the transitive closure of their
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' properties.  CMake supports multiple
strategies for nominally ordering direct and indirect link dependencies,
which are then filtered for \fI\%Toolchain\-Specific Behavior\fP\&.
.sp
Consider this example for the strategies below:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

add_library(A STATIC ...)
add_library(B STATIC ...)
add_library(C STATIC ...)

The supported strategies are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBREORDER_MINIMALLY\fP
Entries of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' always appear first and in their
original order.  Indirect link dependencies not satisfied by the
original entries may be reordered and de\-duplicated with respect to
one another, but are always appended after the original entries.
This may result in less efficient link lines, but gives projects
control of ordering among independent entries.  Such control may be
important when intermixing link flags with libraries, or when multiple
libraries provide a given symbol.
.sp
This is the default.
.sp
In the above example, this strategy computes a link line for \fBmain\fP
by starting with its original entries \fBA B C\fP, and then appends
another \fBA\fP to satisfy the dependencies of \fBB\fP and \fBC\fP on \fBA\fP\&.
The nominal order produced by this strategy is \fBA B C A\fP\&.
.sp
Note that additional filtering for \fI\%Toolchain\-Specific Behavior\fP
may de\-duplicate \fBA\fP on the actual linker invocation in the
generated build system, resulting in either \fBA B C\fP or \fBB C A\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBREORDER_FREELY\fP
Entries of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_LIBRARIES'\fI\%LINK_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' may be reordered, de\-duplicated,
and intermixed with indirect link dependencies.  This may result in
more efficient link lines, but does not give projects any control of
ordering among independent entries.
.sp
In the above example, this strategy computes a link line for \fBmain\fP
by re\-ordering its original entries \fBA B C\fP to satisfy the
dependencies of \fBB\fP and \fBC\fP on \fBA\fP\&.
The nominal order produced by this strategy is \fBB C A\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Toolchain\-Specific Behavior
.sp
After one of the above strategies produces a nominal order among
direct and indirect link dependencies, the actual linker invocation
in the generated build system may de\-duplicate entries based on
platform\-specific requirements and linker capabilities.
See policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0156'\fI\%CMP0156\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
For example, if the \fBREORDER_MINIMALLY\fP strategy produces \fBA B C A\fP,
the actual link line may de\-duplicate \fBA\fP as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBA\fP is a static library and the linker re\-scans automatically,
the first occurrence is kept, resulting in \fBA B C\fP\&.
See policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0179'\fI\%CMP0179\fP\X'tty: link'
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBA\fP is a shared library on Windows, the first
occurrence is kept, resulting in \fBA B C\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
If \fBA\fP is a shared library on macOS or UNIX platforms, the last
occurrence is kept, resulting in \fBB C A\fP\&.

.SS LINK_LIBRARY_OVERRIDE
.sp
Added in version 3.24.

.sp
Override the library features associated with libraries from
\X'tty: link #genex:LINK_LIBRARY'\fI\%LINK_LIBRARY\fP\X'tty: link' generator expressions.  This can be used to resolve
incompatible library features that result from specifying different features
for the same library in different \X'tty: link #genex:LINK_LIBRARY'\fI\%LINK_LIBRARY\fP\X'tty: link' generator expressions.
.sp
This property supports overriding multiple libraries and features. It expects
a \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link', where each list item
has the following form:

libraries need to use the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS'\fI\%STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.sp
These options are used for both normal linking and device linking
(see policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0105'\fI\%CMP0105\fP\X'tty: link'). To control link options for normal and device
link steps, \X'tty: link #genex:HOST_LINK'\fI\%$<HOST_LINK>\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #genex:DEVICE_LINK'\fI\%$<DEVICE_LINK>\fP\X'tty: link' generator
expressions can be used.

\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS'\fI\%CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS\fP\X'tty: link' properties and policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0105'\fI\%CMP0105\fP\X'tty: link',
the raw options will be delivered to the host and device link steps (wrapped in
\fB\-Xcompiler\fP or equivalent for device link). Options wrapped with
\X'tty: link #genex:DEVICE_LINK'\fI\%$<DEVICE_LINK:...>\fP\X'tty: link' generator expression will be used
only for the device link step. Options wrapped with \X'tty: link #genex:HOST_LINK'\fI\%$<HOST_LINK:...>\fP\X'tty: link'
generator expression will be used only for the host link step.

.SS Option De\-duplication
.sp
The final set of options used for a target is constructed by
accumulating options from the current target and the usage requirements of
its dependencies.  The set of options is de\-duplicated to avoid repetition.
.sp
Added in version 3.12: While beneficial for individual options, the de\-duplication step can break
up option groups.  For example, \fB\-option A \-option B\fP becomes
\fB\-option A B\fP\&.  One may specify a group of options using shell\-like
quoting along with a \fBSHELL:\fP prefix.  The \fBSHELL:\fP prefix is dropped,
and the rest of the option string is parsed using the
\X'tty: link #command:separate_arguments'\fI\%separate_arguments()\fP\X'tty: link' \fBUNIX_COMMAND\fP mode. For example,
\fB\(dqSHELL:\-option A\(dq \(dqSHELL:\-option B\(dq\fP becomes \fB\-option A \-option B\fP\&.

.SS Handling Compiler Driver Differences
.sp
To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.
The \fBLINKER:\fP prefix and \fB,\fP separator can be used to specify, in a portable
way, options to pass to the linker tool. \fBLINKER:\fP is replaced by the
appropriate driver option and \fB,\fP by the appropriate driver separator.
The driver prefix and driver separator are given by the values of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG'\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG\fP\X'tty: link' and
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP'\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP\fP\X'tty: link' variables.
.sp
For example, \fB\(dqLINKER:\-z,defs\(dq\fP becomes \fB\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\fP for
\fBClang\fP and \fB\-Wl,\-z,defs\fP for \fBGNU GCC\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBLINKER:\fP prefix can be specified as part of a \fBSHELL:\fP prefix
expression.
.sp
The \fBLINKER:\fP prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of

End a link line such that static system libraries are used.
.sp
Some linkers support switches such as \fB\-Bstatic\fP and \fB\-Bdynamic\fP to

CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the
end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker
search type to \fB\-Bstatic\fP regardless of how it started.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable

Linker types are case\-sensitive and may only contain letters, numbers and
underscores. Linker types defined in all uppercase are reserved for CMake\(aqs own
built\-in types. The pre\-defined linker types are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBDEFAULT\fP
This type corresponds to standard linking, essentially equivalent to the
\fI\%LINKER_TYPE\fP target property not being set at all.
.TP
.B \fBSYSTEM\fP
Use the standard linker provided by the platform or toolchain. For example,
this implies the Microsoft linker for all MSVC\-compatible compilers.
This type is supported for the following platform\-compiler combinations:
.INDENT 7.0

.TP
.B \fBMOLD\fP
Use the \X'tty: link https://github.com/rui314/mold'\fI\%mold linker\fP\X'tty: link'\&. This type is
supported on the following platform\-compiler combinations:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Linux: \fBGNU\fP, \fBClang\fP, \fBLLVMFlang\fP, and \fBNVIDIA\fP compilers.

Apple platforms: \fBClang\fP and \fBAppleClang\fP compilers (acts as an
alias to the \X'tty: link https://github.com/bluewhalesystems/sold'\fI\%sold linker\fP\X'tty: link').
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBSOLD\fP
Use the \X'tty: link https://github.com/bluewhalesystems/sold'\fI\%sold linker\fP\X'tty: link'\&. This type is only supported on Apple platforms
with \fBClang\fP and \fBAppleClang\fP compilers.
.TP
.B \fBAPPLE_CLASSIC\fP
Use the Apple linker in the classic behavior (i.e. before \fBXcode 15.0\fP).
This type is only supported on Apple platforms with \fBGNU\fP, \fBClang\fP,
\fBAppleClang\fP, and \fBSwift\fP compilers.
.TP
.B \fBMSVC\fP
Use the Microsoft linker. This type is only supported on the Windows
platform with \fBMSVC\fP, \fBClang\fP with MSVC\-like front\-end, and \fBSwift\fP
compilers.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This property is not supported on \X'tty: link #generator:Green Hills MULTI'\fI\%Green Hills MULTI\fP\X'tty: link' generator.
.sp
The implementation details for the selected linker will be provided by the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_<LANG>_USING_LINKER_<TYPE>'\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_USING_LINKER_<TYPE>\fP\X'tty: link' variable. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(lib1 SHARED ...)
set_property(TARGET lib1 PROPERTY LINKER_TYPE LLD)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This specifies that \fBlib1\fP should use linker type \fBLLD\fP for the link step.
The command line options that will be passed to the toolchain will be provided
by the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_USING_LINKER_LLD\fP variable.
.sp
Note that the linker would typically be set using \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_LINKER_TYPE'\fI\%CMAKE_LINKER_TYPE\fP\X'tty: link'
for the whole build rather than setting the \fBLINKER_TYPE\fP property on
individual targets.
.SS LOCATION
.sp
Read\-only location of a target on disk.
.sp
For an imported target, this read\-only property returns the value of
the \fBLOCATION_<CONFIG>\fP property for an unspecified configuration
\fB<CONFIG>\fP provided by the target.
.sp
For a non\-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility
with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an
executable target\(aqs output file for use in \X'tty: link #command:add_custom_command'\fI\%add_custom_command()\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  The
path may contain a build\-system\-specific portion that is replaced at
build time with the configuration getting built (such as
\fB$(ConfigurationName)\fP in VS).  In CMake 2.6 and above
\X'tty: link #command:add_custom_command'\fI\%add_custom_command()\fP\X'tty: link' automatically recognizes a target name in its
\fBCOMMAND\fP and \fBDEPENDS\fP options and computes the target location.  In
CMake 2.8.4 and above \X'tty: link #command:add_custom_command'\fI\%add_custom_command()\fP\X'tty: link' recognizes
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'
to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.
Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.
.sp
Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
\fB(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?\fP,
\fB(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)\fP, or \(dqLINKER_LANGUAGE\(dq.  Failure to follow
this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.
.SS LOCATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
Read\-only property providing a target location on disk.
.sp
A read\-only property that indicates where a target\(aqs main file is
located on disk for the configuration \fB<CONFIG>\fP\&.  The property is
defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported target
may provide a set of configurations different from that of the
importing project.  By default CMake looks for an exact\-match but
otherwise uses an arbitrary available configuration.  Use the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>'\fI\%MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' property to map imported
configurations explicitly.
.sp
Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
\fB(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?\fP,
\fB(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)\fP, or  \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINKER_LANGUAGE'\fI\%LINKER_LANGUAGE\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
Failure to follow this rule is not diagnosed and leaves
the location of the target undefined.
.SS MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
.sp
Added in version 3.17.

.sp
What compatibility version number is this target for Mach\-O binaries.
.sp
For shared libraries on Mach\-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS)
the \fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP property corresponds to the
\fIcompatibility version\fP and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' corresponds to
the \fIcurrent version\fP\&.  These are both embedded in the shared library binary
and can be checked with the \fBotool \-L <binary>\fP command.
.sp
It should be noted that the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' and
\fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP properties do not affect the file
names or version\-related symlinks that CMake generates for the library.
The \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:VERSION'\fI\%VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link' target properties still
control the file and symlink names.  The \fBinstall_name\fP is also still
controlled by \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
When \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' and \fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP
are not given, \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:VERSION'\fI\%VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link' are used for
the version details to be embedded in the binaries respectively.
The \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' and \fBMACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP
properties only need to be given if the project needs to decouple the file
and symlink naming from the version details embedded in the binaries
(e.g. to match libtool conventions).
.SS MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION
.sp
Added in version 3.17.

.sp
What current version number is this target for Mach\-O binaries.
.sp
For shared libraries on Mach\-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS)
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' property corresponds to the
\fIcompatibility version\fP and \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP corresponds to the
\fIcurrent version\fP\&.  These are both embedded in the shared library binary
and can be checked with the \fBotool \-L <binary>\fP command.
.sp
It should be noted that the \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP and
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' properties do not affect the file
names or version\-related symlinks that CMake generates for the library.
The \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:VERSION'\fI\%VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link' target properties still
control the file and symlink names.  The \fBinstall_name\fP is also still
controlled by \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
When \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link'
are not given, \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:VERSION'\fI\%VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link' are used for
the version details to be embedded in the binaries respectively.
The \fBMACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link'
properties only need to be given if the project needs to decouple the file
and symlink naming from the version details embedded in the binaries
(e.g. to match libtool conventions).
.SS MACOSX_BUNDLE
.sp
Build an executable as an Application Bundle on macOS or iOS.
.sp
When this property is set to \fBTRUE\fP the executable when built on macOS
or iOS will be created as an application bundle.  This makes it
a GUI executable that can be launched from the Finder.  See the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST'\fI\%MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST\fP\X'tty: link' target property for information about
creation of the \fBInfo.plist\fP file for the application bundle.
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE'\fI\%CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set when a target is created.
.SS MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST
.sp
Specify a custom \fBInfo.plist\fP template for a macOS and iOS Application Bundle.
.sp
An executable target with \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACOSX_BUNDLE'\fI\%MACOSX_BUNDLE\fP\X'tty: link' enabled will be built as an
application bundle on macOS.  By default its \fBInfo.plist\fP file is created
by configuring a template called \fBMacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in\fP located in the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_MODULE_PATH'\fI\%CMAKE_MODULE_PATH\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  This property specifies an alternative template
file name which may be a full path.
.sp
The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleName\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION\fP

.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleIconFile\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleGetInfoString\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleLongVersionString\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleShortVersionString\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
\fBInfo.plist\fP is specified by this property it may of course hard\-code
all the settings instead of using the target properties.
.SS MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST
.sp
Specify a custom \fBInfo.plist\fP template for a macOS and iOS Framework.
.sp
A library target with \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FRAMEWORK'\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link' enabled will be built as a
framework on macOS.  By default its \fBInfo.plist\fP file is created by
configuring a template called \fBMacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in\fP located in the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_MODULE_PATH'\fI\%CMAKE_MODULE_PATH\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  This property specifies an alternative template
file name which may be a full path.
.sp
The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_NAME\fP
Added in version 3.31.

.sp
Sets \fBCFBundleName\fP\&.

.B \fBMACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleIconFile\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleIdentifier\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleShortVersionString\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
\fBInfo.plist\fP is specified by this property it may of course hard\-code
all the settings instead of using the target properties.
.SS MACOSX_RPATH
.sp
Whether this target on macOS or iOS is located at runtime using rpaths.
.sp
When this property is set to \fBTRUE\fP, the directory portion of
the \fBinstall_name\fP field of this shared library will be \fB@rpath\fP
unless overridden by \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_NAME_DIR'\fI\%INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  This indicates
the shared library is to be found at runtime using runtime
paths (rpaths).
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH'\fI\%CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
Runtime paths will also be embedded in binaries using this target and
can be controlled by the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INSTALL_RPATH'\fI\%INSTALL_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' target property on
the target linking to this target.
.sp
Policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0042'\fI\%CMP0042\fP\X'tty: link' was introduced to change the default value of
\fBMACOSX_RPATH\fP to \fBTRUE\fP\&.  This is because use of \fB@rpath\fP is a
more flexible and powerful alternative to \fB@executable_path\fP and
\fB@loader_path\fP\&.
.SS MANUALLY_ADDED_DEPENDENCIES
.sp
Added in version 3.8.

.sp
Get manually added dependencies to other top\-level targets.
.sp
This read\-only property can be used to query all dependencies that
were added for this target with the \X'tty: link #command:add_dependencies'\fI\%add_dependencies()\fP\X'tty: link'
command.
.SS MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>
.sp
Map from project configuration to
\X'tty: link #imported-targets'\fI\%imported target\fP\X'tty: link'\(aqs configuration.
.sp
Set this to the list of configurations of an imported target that may
be used for the current project\(aqs \fB<CONFIG>\fP configuration.  Targets
imported from another project may not provide the same set of
configuration names available in the current project.  Setting this
property tells CMake what imported configurations are suitable for use
when building the \fB<CONFIG>\fP configuration.  The first configuration in
the list found to be provided by the imported target (i.e. via
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>'\fI\%IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' for the mapped\-to \fB<CONFIG>\fP)
is selected.  As a special case, an empty list element refers to the
configuration\-less imported target location
(i.e. \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LOCATION'\fI\%IMPORTED_LOCATION\fP\X'tty: link').
.sp
If this property is set and no matching configurations are available,
then the imported target is considered to be not found.  This property
is ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>'\fI\%CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set when a
target is created.

.SS NAME
.sp
Logical name for the target.

Read\-only logical name for the target as used by CMake.
.SS NO_SONAME
.sp
Whether to set \fBsoname\fP when linking a shared library.
.sp
Enable this boolean property if a generated \fBSHARED\fP library
should not have \fBsoname\fP set.  Default is to set \fBsoname\fP on all
shared libraries as long as the platform supports it.
Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries or
plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other targets
link against, on some platforms a linker will insert a full path to
the library (as specified at link time) into the dynamic section of
the dependent binary.  Therefore, once installed, dynamic loader may
eventually fail to locate the library for the binary.

contents of the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' target property are
treated as system includes or, on Apple platforms, when the target is a

true for imported targets and false for other target types.  If the

compilation of sources in that consuming target will not treat the contents of
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' of consumed imported targets as

.SS OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES
.sp
Added in version 3.19.

.sp
Activates dependency optimization of static and object libraries.
.sp
When this property is set to true, some dependencies for a static or object
library may be removed at generation time if they are not necessary to build
the library, since static and object libraries don\(aqt actually link against
anything.
.sp
If a static or object library has dependency optimization enabled, it first
discards all dependencies. Then, it looks through all of the direct and
indirect dependencies that it initially had, and adds them back if they meet
any of the following criteria:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The dependency was added to the library by \X'tty: link #command:add_dependencies'\fI\%add_dependencies()\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The dependency was added to the library through a source file in the library
generated by a custom command that uses the dependency.
.IP \(bu 2
The dependency has any \fBPRE_BUILD\fP, \fBPRE_LINK\fP, or \fBPOST_BUILD\fP custom
commands associated with it.
.IP \(bu 2
The dependency contains any source files that were generated by a custom
command.
.IP \(bu 2
The dependency contains any languages which produce side effects that are
relevant to the library. Currently, all languages except C, C++, Objective\-C,
Objective\-C++, assembly, and CUDA are assumed to produce side effects.
However, side effects from one language are assumed not to be relevant to
another (for example, a Fortran library is assumed to not have any side
effects that are relevant for a Swift library.)
.UNINDENT
.sp
As an example, assume you have a static Fortran library which depends on a
static C library, which in turn depends on a static Fortran library. The
top\-level Fortran library has optimization enabled, but the middle C library
does not. If you build the top Fortran library, the bottom Fortran library will
also build, but not the middle C library, since the C library does not have any
side effects that are relevant for the Fortran library. However, if you build
the middle C library, the bottom Fortran library will also build, even though
it does not have any side effects that are relevant to the C library, since the
C library does not have optimization enabled.

This property is initialized by the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES'\fI\%CMAKE_OPTIMIZE_DEPENDENCIES\fP\X'tty: link' variable when the target is created.
.SS OSX_ARCHITECTURES
.sp
Target specific architectures for macOS.
.sp
The \fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP property sets the target binary architecture for
targets on macOS (\fB\-arch\fP).  This property is initialized by the value of the
variable \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES'\fI\%CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set when a target is

Specify public header files in a \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FRAMEWORK'\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link' shared library target.
.sp
Shared library targets marked with the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FRAMEWORK'\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link' property generate
frameworks on macOS, iOS and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the
\fBHeaders\fP directory inside the framework folder.  On non\-Apple platforms
these headers may be installed using the \fBPUBLIC_HEADER\fP option to the
\X'tty: link #targets'\fI\%install(TARGETS)\fP\X'tty: link' command.
.SS RESOURCE
.sp
Specify resource files in a \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FRAMEWORK'\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUNDLE'\fI\%BUNDLE\fP\X'tty: link'\&.

.sp
Output directory in which to build \X'tty: link #runtime-output-artifacts'\fI\%RUNTIME\fP\X'tty: link' target files.

\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>'\fI\%CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' variable if
it is set when a target is created.
.sp

\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME
.sp
Output name for \X'tty: link #runtime-output-artifacts'\fI\%RUNTIME\fP\X'tty: link' target files.
.sp
This property specifies the base name for runtime target files.  It
overrides \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:OUTPUT_NAME'\fI\%OUTPUT_NAME\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>'\fI\%OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link'

.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME'\fI\%RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.SS SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
.sp
Should rpaths be used for the build tree.
.sp
\fBSKIP_BUILD_RPATH\fP is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic
generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree,
see also the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUILD_RPATH'\fI\%BUILD_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH'\fI\%CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH\fP\X'tty: link' if it is set when a target is created.
.SS SOURCE_DIR
.sp
Added in version 3.4.

.sp
This read\-only property reports the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR'\fI\%CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR\fP\X'tty: link' variable in the directory in which
the target was defined.
.SS SOURCES
.sp
This specifies the list of paths to source files for the target.
The following commands all set or add to the \fBSOURCES\fP target property
and are the usual way to manipulate it:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\X'tty: link #command:add_executable'\fI\%add_executable()\fP\X'tty: link'
.IP \(bu 2
\X'tty: link #command:add_library'\fI\%add_library()\fP\X'tty: link'
.IP \(bu 2
\X'tty: link #command:add_custom_target'\fI\%add_custom_target()\fP\X'tty: link'
.IP \(bu 2
\X'tty: link #command:target_sources'\fI\%target_sources()\fP\X'tty: link'
.UNINDENT
.sp
Contents of \fBSOURCES\fP may use
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
If a path starts with a generator expression, it is expected to
evaluate to an absolute path. Not doing so is considered undefined behavior.
.sp
Paths that are for files generated by the build will be treated
as relative to the build directory of the target, if the path is not
already specified as an absolute path.  Note that whether a file is seen as
generated may be affected by policies \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0118'\fI\%CMP0118\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0163'\fI\%CMP0163\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
If a path does not start with a generator expression, is not an
absolute path and is not a generated file, it will be treated as relative to
the location selected by the first of the following that matches:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If a file by the specified path exists relative to the target\(aqs source
directory, use that file.
.IP \(bu 2
If policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0115'\fI\%CMP0115\fP\X'tty: link' is not set to \fBNEW\fP, try appending each
known source file extension to the path and check if that exists
relative to the target\(aqs source directory.
.IP \(bu 2
Repeat the above two steps, this time relative to the target\(aqs binary
directory instead.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the above decisions are made at generation time, not build time.
.sp
See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-buildsystem(7)'\fI\%cmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual for more on defining
buildsystem properties.
.SS SOVERSION
.sp
ABI version number of a shared library target.
.sp
For shared libraries \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:VERSION'\fI\%VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' and \fBSOVERSION\fP can be used to
specify the build version and ABI version respectively.  When building or
installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
symlinks and the linker supports so\-names.  If only one of both is
specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.
\fBSOVERSION\fP is ignored if \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:NO_SONAME'\fI\%NO_SONAME\fP\X'tty: link' property is set.
.sp
A common convention is to specify both \fBVERSION\fP and \fBSOVERSION\fP
such that \fBSOVERSION\fP matches the first component of \fBVERSION\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_target_properties(mylib PROPERTIES VERSION 1.2.3 SOVERSION 1)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The idea is that breaking changes to the ABI increment both the
\fBSOVERSION\fP and the major \fBVERSION\fP number.
.SS Windows Versions
.sp
For shared libraries and executables on Windows the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:VERSION'\fI\%VERSION\fP\X'tty: link'
attribute is parsed to extract a \fB<major>.<minor>\fP version number.
These numbers are used as the image version of the binary.
.SS Mach\-O Versions
.sp
For shared libraries and executables on Mach\-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS),
the \fBSOVERSION\fP property corresponds to the \fIcompatibility version\fP and
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:VERSION'\fI\%VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' corresponds to the \fIcurrent version\fP (unless Mach\-O
specific overrides are provided, as discussed below).
See the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FRAMEWORK'\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link' target property for an example.
.sp
For shared libraries, the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' and
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' properties can be used to
override the \fIcompatibility version\fP and \fIcurrent version\fP respectively.
Note that \fBSOVERSION\fP will still be used to form the \fBinstall_name\fP
and both \fBSOVERSION\fP and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:VERSION'\fI\%VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' may also affect the file
and symlink names.
.sp
Versions of Mach\-O binaries may be checked with the \fBotool \-L <binary>\fP
command.
.SS STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS
.sp
Archiver (or MSVC librarian) flags for a static library target.
Targets that are shared libraries, modules, or executables need to use
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_OPTIONS'\fI\%LINK_OPTIONS\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_FLAGS'\fI\%LINK_FLAGS\fP\X'tty: link' target properties.
.sp
The \fBSTATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS\fP property, managed as a string, can be used to add
extra flags to the link step of a static library target.
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_<CONFIG>'\fI\%STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_<CONFIG>\fP\X'tty: link' will add to the configuration
\fB<CONFIG>\fP, for example, \fBDEBUG\fP, \fBRELEASE\fP, \fBMINSIZEREL\fP,
\fBRELWITHDEBINFO\fP, ...

Archiver (or MSVC librarian) flags for a static library target.
Targets that are shared libraries, modules, or executables need to use
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:LINK_OPTIONS'\fI\%LINK_OPTIONS\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.sp
This property holds a \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of options
specified so far for its target.  Use \X'tty: link #command:set_target_properties'\fI\%set_target_properties()\fP\X'tty: link' or

.SS Option De\-duplication
.sp
The final set of options used for a target is constructed by
accumulating options from the current target and the usage requirements of
its dependencies.  The set of options is de\-duplicated to avoid repetition.
.sp
Added in version 3.12: While beneficial for individual options, the de\-duplication step can break
up option groups.  For example, \fB\-option A \-option B\fP becomes
\fB\-option A B\fP\&.  One may specify a group of options using shell\-like
quoting along with a \fBSHELL:\fP prefix.  The \fBSHELL:\fP prefix is dropped,
and the rest of the option string is parsed using the
\X'tty: link #command:separate_arguments'\fI\%separate_arguments()\fP\X'tty: link' \fBUNIX_COMMAND\fP mode. For example,
\fB\(dqSHELL:\-option A\(dq \(dqSHELL:\-option B\(dq\fP becomes \fB\-option A \-option B\fP\&.

.SS SUFFIX
.sp
What comes after the target name.
.sp
A target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
\fB\&.so\fP or \fB\&.exe\fP) on the name of a library, module or executable.
.SS Swift_COMPILATION_MODE
.sp
Added in version 3.29.

.sp
Specify how Swift compiles a target.
.sp
The allowed values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBincremental\fP
Compiles each Swift source in the module separately, resulting in better
parallelism in the build. The compiler emits additional information into
the build directory improving rebuild performance when small changes are made
to the source between rebuilds. This is the best option to use while
iterating on changes in a project.
.TP
.B \fBwholemodule\fP
Whole\-module optimizations are slowest to compile, but results in the most
optimized library. The entire context is loaded into once instance of the
compiler, so there is no parallelism across source files in the module.
.TP
.B \fBsinglefile\fP
Compiles each source in a Swift modules separately, resulting in better
parallelism. Unlike the \fBincremental\fP build mode, no additional information
is emitted by the compiler during the build, so rebuilding after making small
changes to the source file will not run faster. This option should be used
sparingly, preferring \fBincremental\fP builds, unless working around a compiler
bug.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link' to support
per\-configuration specification. For example, the code:

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Swift_DEPENDENCIES_FILE
.sp

.sp
This property sets the path for the Swift dependency file (swiftdep) for the
target.  If one is not specified, it will default to \fB<TARGET>.swiftdeps\fP\&.
.SS Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION
.sp
Added in version 3.16.

.sp
This property sets the language version for the Swift sources in the target.  If
one is not specified, it will default to
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION'\fI\%CMAKE_Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' if specified, otherwise it is the
latest version supported by the compiler.
.SS Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY
.sp
Added in version 3.15.

.sp
Specify output directory for Swift modules provided by the target.
.sp
If the target contains Swift source files, this specifies the directory in which
the modules will be placed.  When this property is not set, the modules will be
placed in the build directory corresponding to the target\(aqs source directory.
If the variable \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY'\fI\%CMAKE_Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY\fP\X'tty: link' is set when a target is
created its value is used to initialize this property.
.sp

.SS SYSTEM
.sp
Added in version 3.25.

.sp
Specifies that a target is a system target.  This has the following
effects:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Entries of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' are treated as
system include directories when compiling consumers.
Entries of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' are not

For imported targets, this property defaults to true, which means
that their \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' and, if the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FRAMEWORK'\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link' target property is true, frameworks directory are
treated as system directories by default.  If their \fBSYSTEM\fP property is
false, then their \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' as well as
frameworks will not be treated as system.  Use the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:EXPORT_NO_SYSTEM'\fI\%EXPORT_NO_SYSTEM\fP\X'tty: link'

For non\-imported targets, this target property is initialized from
the \X'tty: link #prop_dir:SYSTEM'\fI\%SYSTEM\fP\X'tty: link' directory property when the target is created.
.SS TEST_LAUNCHER

Added in version 3.29.

.sp
Use the given launcher to run executables.
This command will be added as a prefix to \X'tty: link #command:add_test'\fI\%add_test()\fP\X'tty: link' commands
for build target system executables and is meant to be run on the host

.sp
It effectively acts as a run script for tests in a similar way
to how \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER'\fI\%CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER\fP\X'tty: link' works for compilation.
.sp
If this property contains a \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link', then the first value is the command and remaining values are its

Properties that the \X'tty: link #genex:TARGET_PROPERTY'\fI\%TARGET_PROPERTY\fP\X'tty: link' generator expression, on the
target and its dependents, evaluates as the union of values collected from
the transitive closure of link dependencies, including entries guarded by
\X'tty: link #genex:LINK_ONLY'\fI\%LINK_ONLY\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
The value is a \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link'
of \X'tty: link #custom-transitive-properties'\fI\%custom transitive property\fP\X'tty: link' names.
Any leading \fBINTERFACE_\fP prefix is ignored, e.g., \fBINTERFACE_PROP\fP is
treated as just \fBPROP\fP\&.
.sp
See documentation of the \X'tty: link #genex:TARGET_PROPERTY'\fI\%TARGET_PROPERTY\fP\X'tty: link' generator expression
for details of custom transitive property evaluation.  See also the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:TRANSITIVE_COMPILE_PROPERTIES'\fI\%TRANSITIVE_COMPILE_PROPERTIES\fP\X'tty: link' target property, which excludes
entries guarded by \X'tty: link #genex:LINK_ONLY'\fI\%LINK_ONLY\fP\X'tty: link'\&..
.SS TYPE
.sp
The type of the target.
.sp
This read\-only property can be used to test the type of the given
target.  It will be one of \fBSTATIC_LIBRARY\fP, \fBMODULE_LIBRARY\fP,
\fBSHARED_LIBRARY\fP, \fBOBJECT_LIBRARY\fP, \fBINTERFACE_LIBRARY\fP, \fBEXECUTABLE\fP
or one of the internal target types.
.SS UNITY_BUILD
.sp
Added in version 3.16.

.sp
When this property is set to true, the target source files will be combined
into batches for faster compilation.  This is done by creating a (set of)
unity sources which \fB#include\fP the original sources, then compiling these
unity sources instead of the originals.  This is known as a \fIUnity\fP or \fIJumbo\fP
build.
.sp
CMake provides different algorithms for selecting which sources are grouped
together into a \fIbucket\fP\&. Algorithm selection is decided by the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD_MODE'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD_MODE\fP\X'tty: link' target property, which has the following acceptable
values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBATCH\fP
When in this mode CMake determines which files are grouped together.
The \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE\fP\X'tty: link' property controls the upper limit on
how many sources can be combined per unity source file.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBGROUP\fP
When in this mode each target explicitly specifies how to group
source files. Each source file that has the same
\X'tty: link #prop_sf:UNITY_GROUP'\fI\%UNITY_GROUP\fP\X'tty: link' value will be grouped together. Any sources
that don\(aqt have this property will be compiled individually. The
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE\fP\X'tty: link' property is ignored when using
this mode.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If no explicit \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD_MODE'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD_MODE\fP\X'tty: link' has been specified, CMake will
default to \fBBATCH\fP\&.
.sp
Unity builds are supported for the following languages:
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.sp
For targets that mix source files from more than one language, CMake
separates the languages such that each generated unity source file only
contains sources for a single language.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD'\fI\%CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD\fP\X'tty: link'
variable when a target is created.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Projects should not directly set the \fBUNITY_BUILD\fP property or its
associated \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD'\fI\%CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD\fP\X'tty: link' variable to true.  Depending
on the capabilities of the build machine and compiler used, it might or
might not be appropriate to enable unity builds.  Therefore, this feature
should be under developer control, which would normally be through the
developer choosing whether or not to set the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD'\fI\%CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD\fP\X'tty: link'
variable on the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake(1)'\fI\%cmake(1)\fP\X'tty: link' command line or some other equivalent
method.  However, it IS recommended to set the \fBUNITY_BUILD\fP target
property to false if it is known that enabling unity builds for the
target can lead to problems.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ODR (One definition rule) errors
.sp
When multiple source files are included into one source file, as is done
for unity builds, it can potentially lead to ODR errors.  CMake provides
a number of measures to help address such problems:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Any source file that has a non\-empty \X'tty: link #prop_sf:COMPILE_OPTIONS'\fI\%COMPILE_OPTIONS\fP\X'tty: link',
\X'tty: link #prop_sf:COMPILE_DEFINITIONS'\fI\%COMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #prop_sf:COMPILE_FLAGS'\fI\%COMPILE_FLAGS\fP\X'tty: link', or
\X'tty: link #prop_sf:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' source property will not be combined
into a unity source.
.IP \(bu 2
Any source file which is scanned for C++ module sources via
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES'\fI\%CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #prop_sf:CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES'\fI\%CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES\fP\X'tty: link', or
membership of a \fBCXX_MODULES\fP file set will not be combined into a unity
source.  See \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-cxxmodules(7)'\fI\%cmake\-cxxmodules(7)\fP\X'tty: link' for details.
.IP \(bu 2
Projects can prevent an individual source file from being combined into
a unity source by setting its \X'tty: link #prop_sf:SKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION'\fI\%SKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION\fP\X'tty: link'
source property to true.  This can be a more effective way to prevent
problems with specific files than disabling unity builds for an entire
target.
.IP \(bu 2
Projects can set \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD_UNIQUE_ID'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD_UNIQUE_ID\fP\X'tty: link' to cause a valid
C\-identifier to be generated which is unique per file in a unity
build.  This can be used to avoid problems with anonymous namespaces
in unity builds.
.IP \(bu 2
The \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD_CODE_BEFORE_INCLUDE'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD_CODE_BEFORE_INCLUDE\fP\X'tty: link' and
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD_CODE_AFTER_INCLUDE'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD_CODE_AFTER_INCLUDE\fP\X'tty: link' target properties can be used
to inject code into the unity source files before and after every
\fB#include\fP statement.
.IP \(bu 2
The order of source files added to the target via commands like
\X'tty: link #command:add_library'\fI\%add_library()\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #command:add_executable'\fI\%add_executable()\fP\X'tty: link' or
\X'tty: link #command:target_sources'\fI\%target_sources()\fP\X'tty: link' will be preserved in the generated unity source
files.  This can be used to manually enforce a specific grouping based on
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE\fP\X'tty: link' target property.
.UNINDENT
.SS UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE
.sp
Added in version 3.16.

.sp
Specifies the maximum number of source files that can be combined into any one
unity source file when unity builds are enabled by the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD\fP\X'tty: link'
target property.  The original source files will be distributed across as many
unity source files as necessary to honor this limit.
.sp
The initial value for this property is taken from the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE'\fI\%CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE\fP\X'tty: link' variable when the target is created.
If that variable has not been set, the initial value will be 8.
.sp
The batch size needs to be selected carefully.  If set too high, the size of
the combined source files could result in the compiler using excessive memory
or hitting other similar limits.  In extreme cases, this can even result in
build failure.  On the other hand, if the batch size is too low, there will be
little gain in build performance.
.sp
Although strongly discouraged, the batch size may be set to a value of 0 to
combine all the sources for the target into a single unity file, regardless of
how many sources are involved.  This runs the risk of creating an excessively
large unity source file and negatively impacting the build performance, so
a value of 0 is not generally recommended.
.SS UNITY_BUILD_CODE_AFTER_INCLUDE
.sp
Added in version 3.16.

.sp
Code snippet which is included verbatim by the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD\fP\X'tty: link'

CMake provides different algorithms for selecting which sources are grouped
together into a \fIbucket\fP\&. Selection is decided by this property,
which has the following acceptable values:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBBATCH\fP
When in this mode CMake determines which files are grouped together.
The \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE\fP\X'tty: link' property controls the upper limit on

.SS UNITY_BUILD_UNIQUE_ID
.sp
Added in version 3.20.

.sp
The name of a valid C\-identifier which is set to a unique per\-file
value during unity builds.
.sp
When this property is populated and when \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD\fP\X'tty: link'

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
the \fBMY_UNITY_ID\fP symbol is defined to a unique per\-file value.
.sp
One known use case for this identifier is to disambiguate the
variables in an anonymous namespace in a limited scope.
Anonymous namespaces present a problem for unity builds because
they are used to ensure that certain variables and declarations
are scoped to a translation unit which is approximated by a
single source file.  When source files are combined in a unity
build file, those variables in different files are combined in
a single translation unit and the names clash.  This property can
be used to avoid that with code like the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// Needed for when unity builds are disabled
#ifndef MY_UNITY_ID
#define MY_UNITY_ID
#endif

namespace { namespace MY_UNITY_ID {
  // The name \(aqi\(aq clashes (or could clash) with other
  // variables in other anonymous namespaces
  int i = 42;
}}

int use_var()
{
  return MY_UNITY_ID::i;
}
.ft P

.sp
The pseudonymous namespace is used within a truly anonymous namespace.
On many platforms, this maintains the invariant that the symbols within
do not get external linkage when performing a unity build.
.SS VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS
.sp
Added in version 3.24.

.sp
Used to verify that all headers in a target\(aqs \fBPUBLIC\fP and \fBINTERFACE\fP
header sets can be included on their own.
.sp
When this property is set to true, and the target is an object library, static
library, shared library, interface library, or executable with exports enabled,
and the target has one or more \fBPUBLIC\fP or \fBINTERFACE\fP header sets, an
object library target named \fB<target_name>_verify_interface_header_sets\fP is
created. This verification target has one source file per header in the
\fBPUBLIC\fP and \fBINTERFACE\fP header sets. Each source file only includes its
associated header file. The verification target links against the original
target to get all of its usage requirements. The verification target has its
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL'\fI\%EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS'\fI\%DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS\fP\X'tty: link'
properties set to true, and its \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTORCC'\fI\%AUTORCC\fP\X'tty: link',
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOUIC'\fI\%AUTOUIC\fP\X'tty: link', and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD\fP\X'tty: link' properties set to false.
.sp
If the header\(aqs \X'tty: link #prop_sf:LANGUAGE'\fI\%LANGUAGE\fP\X'tty: link' property is set, the value of that property
is used to determine the language with which to compile the header file.
Otherwise, if the target has any C++ sources, the header is compiled as C++.
Otherwise, if the target has any C sources, the header is compiled as C.
Otherwise, if C++ is enabled globally, the header is compiled as C++.
Otherwise, if C is enabled globally, the header is compiled as C. Otherwise,
the header file is not compiled.
.sp
If the header\(aqs \X'tty: link #prop_sf:SKIP_LINTING'\fI\%SKIP_LINTING\fP\X'tty: link' property is set to true, the file is
not compiled.
.sp
If any verification targets are created, a top\-level target called
\fBall_verify_interface_header_sets\fP is created which depends on all
verification targets.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS'\fI\%CMAKE_VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set when
a target is created.
.sp
If the project wishes to control which header sets are verified by this
property, it can set \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS_TO_VERIFY'\fI\%INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS_TO_VERIFY\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS VERSION
.sp
Version number of a shared library target.
.sp
For shared libraries \fBVERSION\fP and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link' can be used
to specify the build version and ABI version respectively.  When building or
installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
symlinks and the linker supports so\-names.  If only one of both is
specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For
executables \fBVERSION\fP can be used to specify the build version.  When
building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the
platform supports symlinks.
.sp
A common convention is to specify both \fBVERSION\fP and \fBSOVERSION\fP
such that \fBSOVERSION\fP matches the first component of \fBVERSION\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_target_properties(mylib PROPERTIES VERSION 1.2.3 SOVERSION 1)

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The idea is that breaking changes to the ABI increment both the
\fBSOVERSION\fP and the major \fBVERSION\fP number.
.SS Windows Versions
.sp
For shared libraries and executables on Windows the \fBVERSION\fP
attribute is parsed to extract a \fB<major>.<minor>\fP version number.
These numbers are used as the image version of the binary.
.SS Mach\-O Versions
.sp
For shared libraries and executables on Mach\-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS),
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link' property corresponds to the \fIcompatibility version\fP
and \fBVERSION\fP corresponds to the \fIcurrent version\fP (unless Mach\-O specific
overrides are provided, as discussed below).
See the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FRAMEWORK'\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link' target property for an example.
.sp
For shared libraries, the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' and
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION'\fI\%MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' properties can be used to
override the \fIcompatibility version\fP and \fIcurrent version\fP respectively.
Note that \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link' will still be used to form the
\fBinstall_name\fP and both \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SOVERSION'\fI\%SOVERSION\fP\X'tty: link' and \fBVERSION\fP may also
affect the file and symlink names.
.sp
Versions of Mach\-O binaries may be checked with the \fBotool \-L <binary>\fP
command.
.SS VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN
.sp
Whether to add a compile flag to hide symbols of inline functions
.sp
The \fBVISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN\fP property determines whether a flag for
hiding symbols for inline functions, such as \fB\-fvisibility\-inlines\-hidden\fP,
should be used when invoking the compiler.  This property affects compilation
in sources of all types of targets (subject to policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0063'\fI\%CMP0063\fP\X'tty: link').
.sp
This property is initialized by
the value of the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN'\fI\%CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it
is set when a target is created.
.SS VS_CONFIGURATION_TYPE

.SS VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES_COPY_LOCAL
.sp
Added in version 3.8.

.sp
Sets the \fBCopy Local\fP property for all .NET hint references in the target
.sp
Boolean property to enable/disable copying of .NET hint references to
output directory. The default is \fBON\fP\&.
.SS VS_DOTNET_STARTUP_OBJECT
.sp
Added in version 3.24.

.sp
Sets the startup object property in Visual Studio .NET targets.
The property value defines a full qualified class name (including package
name), for example: \fBMyCompany.Package.MyStarterClass\fP\&.
.sp
If the property is unset, Visual Studio uses the first matching
\fBstatic void Main(string[])\fP function signature by default. When more

.sp
Visual Studio Windows 10 Mobile Extensions Version
.sp
Specifies the version of the Mobile Extensions that should be included in the

Extensions will not be included. To use the same version of the extensions as
the Windows 10 SDK that is being used, you can use the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION'\fI\%CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' variable.
.SS VS_NO_COMPILE_BATCHING
.sp
Added in version 3.24.

.sp
Turn off compile batching for the target. Usually MSBuild calls the compiler
with multiple c/cpp files and compiler starts subprocesses for each file to
make the build parallel. If you want compiler to be invoked with one file at
a time set \fBVS_NO_COMPILE_BATCHING\fP to ON. If this flag is set MSBuild will
call compiler with one c/cpp file at a time. Useful when you want to use tool
that replaces the compiler, for example some build caching tool.

.SS VS_NO_SOLUTION_DEPLOY
.sp
Added in version 3.15.

.sp
Specify that the target should not be marked for deployment to a Windows CE

.sp
Be default, all EXE and shared library (DLL) targets are marked to deploy to
the target device in the generated Visual Studio solution.
.sp
Generator expressions are supported.
.sp
There are reasons one might want to exclude a target / generated project from
deployment:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The library or executable may not be necessary in the primary deploy/debug
scenario, and excluding from deployment saves time in the
develop/download/debug cycle.
.IP \(bu 2
There may be insufficient space on the target device to accommodate all of
the build products.
.IP \(bu 2
Visual Studio 2013 requires a target device IP address be entered for each
target marked for deployment.  For large numbers of targets, this can be
tedious.
NOTE: Visual Studio \fIwill\fP deploy all project dependencies of a project
tagged for deployment to the IP address configured for that project even
if those dependencies are not tagged for deployment.

.SS VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES
.sp
Added in version 3.30.

.sp
Indicate to \X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link' what configurations are considered
debug configurations.  This controls the \fBUseDebugLibraries\fP setting in
each configuration of a \fB\&.vcxproj\fP file.
.sp
The \(dqUse Debug Libraries\(dq setting in Visual Studio projects, despite its
specific\-sounding name, is a general\-purpose indicator of what configurations
are considered debug configurations.  In standalone projects, this may affect
MSBuild\(aqs default selection of MSVC runtime library, optimization flags,
runtime checks, and similar settings.  In CMake projects those settings are
typically generated explicitly based on the project\(aqs specification, e.g.,
the MSVC runtime library is controlled by \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY'\fI\%MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  However,
the \fBUseDebugLibraries\fP indicator is useful for reference by both humans
and tools, and may also affect the behavior of platform\-specific SDKs.
.sp
Set \fBVS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES\fP to a true or false value to indicate whether
each configuration is considered a debug configuration.  The value may also
be the empty string (\fB\(dq\(dq\fP) in which case no \fBUseDebugLibraries\fP will be
added explicitly by CMake, and MSBuild will use its default value, \fBfalse\fP\&.
.sp
Use \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'
for per\-configuration specification.  For example, the code:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_executable(foo foo.c)
set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
  VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES \(dq$<CONFIG:Debug,Custom>\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
indicates that target \fBfoo\fP considers its \(dqDebug\(dq and \(dqCustom\(dq
configurations to be debug configurations, and its other configurations

.sp
The property is initialized from the value of the
\X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES'\fI\%CMAKE_VS_USE_DEBUG_LIBRARIES\fP\X'tty: link' variable, if it is set.
If the property is not set then CMake generates \fBUseDebugLibraries\fP using
heuristics to determine which configurations are debug configurations.
See policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0162'\fI\%CMP0162\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS VS_USER_PROPS
.sp
Added in version 3.8.

.sp
Sets the user props file to be included in the visual studio
C++ project file. The standard path is
\fB$(UserRootDir)\e\eMicrosoft.Cpp.$(Platform).user.props\fP, which is
in most cases the same as
\fB%LOCALAPPDATA%\e\eMicrosoft\e\eMSBuild\e\ev4.0\e\eMicrosoft.Cpp.Win32.user.props\fP
or \fB%LOCALAPPDATA%\e\eMicrosoft\e\eMSBuild\e\ev4.0\e\eMicrosoft.Cpp.x64.user.props\fP\&.
.sp
The \fB*.user.props\fP files can be used for Visual Studio wide
configuration which is independent from cmake.
.SS VS_FILTER_PROPS
.sp
Added in version 3.30.

.sp
Sets the filter props file to be included in the visual studio

.sp
The \fB*.filter.props\fP files can be used for Visual Studio wide

.SS VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_MIN_VERSION
.sp
Added in version 3.4.

.sp
Visual Studio Windows Target Platform Minimum Version
.sp
For Windows 10. Specifies the minimum version of the OS that is being
targeted. For example \fB10.0.10240.0\fP\&. If the value is not specified, the
value of the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION'\fI\%CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION\fP\X'tty: link' variable
will be used on WindowsStore projects.  Otherwise the target platform
minimum version will not be specified for the project.

.SS WIN32_EXECUTABLE
.sp
Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.
.sp
When this property is set to true the executable when linked on
Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of just
main().  This makes it a GUI executable instead of a console application.
See the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_MFC_FLAG'\fI\%CMAKE_MFC_FLAG\fP\X'tty: link' variable documentation to
configure use of the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) for WinMain
executables.  This property is initialized by the value of the

.SS WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS
.sp
Added in version 3.4.

.sp
This property is implemented only for MS\-compatible tools on Windows.
.sp
Enable this boolean property to automatically create a module definition
(\fB\&.def\fP) file with all global symbols found in the input \fB\&.obj\fP files
for a \fBSHARED\fP library (or executable with \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:ENABLE_EXPORTS'\fI\%ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP\X'tty: link')
on Windows.  The module definition file will be passed to the linker
causing all symbols to be exported from the \fB\&.dll\fP\&.
For global \fIdata\fP symbols, \fB__declspec(dllimport)\fP must still be used when
compiling against the code in the \fB\&.dll\fP\&.  All other function symbols will
be automatically exported and imported by callers.  This simplifies porting
projects to Windows by reducing the need for explicit \fBdllexport\fP markup,
even in \fBC++\fP classes.
.sp
When this property is enabled, zero or more \fB\&.def\fP files may also be
specified as source files of the target.  The exports named by these files
will be merged with those detected from the object files to generate a
single module definition file to be passed to the linker.  This can be
used to export symbols from a \fB\&.dll\fP that are not in any of its object
files but are added by the linker from dependencies (e.g. \fBmsvcrt.lib\fP).
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS'\fI\%CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS\fP\X'tty: link' variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an\-attribute>

.sp
Tell the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' generator to set \fB<an\-attribute>\fP to a given
value in the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.
.sp
This offers low\-level control over the generated Xcode project file.
It is meant as a last resort for specifying settings that CMake does
not otherwise have a way to control.  Although this can override a
setting CMake normally produces on its own, doing so bypasses CMake\(aqs
model of the project and can break things.
.sp
See the \X'tty: link #variable:CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>'\fI\%CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an\-attribute>\fP\X'tty: link' variable

Added in version 3.3.

.sp
This target is a XCTest CFBundle on the Mac.

This property will usually get set via the \X'tty: link #command:xctest_add_bundle'\fI\%xctest_add_bundle()\fP\X'tty: link'
macro in \X'tty: link #module:FindXCTest'\fI\%FindXCTest\fP\X'tty: link' module.
.sp
If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a CFBundle when built on the Mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a CFBundle.
.sp
This property depends on \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUNDLE'\fI\%BUNDLE\fP\X'tty: link' to be effective.
.SH PROPERTIES ON TESTS
.SS ATTACHED_FILES
.sp
Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.
.sp
Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and
submitted to the dashboard as an addition to the test result.
.SS ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL
.sp
Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission if the test fails.
.sp
Same as \X'tty: link #prop_test:ATTACHED_FILES'\fI\%ATTACHED_FILES\fP\X'tty: link', but these files will only be
included if the test does not pass.
.SS COST
.sp
This property describes the cost of a test.  When parallel testing is
enabled, tests in the test set will be run in descending order of cost.
Projects can explicitly define the cost of a test by setting this property
to a floating point value.
.sp
When the cost of a test is not defined by the project,
\X'tty: link #manual:ctest(1)'\fI\%ctest\fP\X'tty: link' will initially use a default cost of \fB0\fP\&.
It computes a weighted average of the cost each time a test is run and
uses that as an improved estimate of the cost for the next run.  The more
a test is re\-run in the same build directory, the more representative the
cost should become.
.SS DEPENDS
.sp
Specifies that this test should only be run after the specified list of tests.
.sp
Set this to a list of tests that must finish before this test is run. The
results of those tests are not considered, the dependency relationship is
purely for order of execution (i.e. it is really just a \fIrun after\fP
relationship). Consider using test fixtures with setup tests if a dependency
with successful completion is required (see \X'tty: link #prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED'\fI\%FIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP\X'tty: link').

A \fBDISABLED\fP test does not participate in test fixture dependency resolution.
If a \fBDISABLED\fP test has fixture requirements defined in its

.SS FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
If the test output (stdout or stderr) matches this regular expression the test
will fail, regardless of the process exit code. Tests that exceed the timeout
specified by \X'tty: link #prop_test:TIMEOUT'\fI\%TIMEOUT\fP\X'tty: link' fail regardless of
\fBFAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP\&. Any non\-zero return code or system\-level test
failures including segmentation faults, signal abort, or heap errors fail the

.SS FIXTURES_CLEANUP
.sp
Added in version 3.7.

.sp
Specifies a list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a cleanup
test. These fixture names are distinct from test case names and are not
required to have any similarity to the names of tests associated with them.
.sp
Fixture cleanup tests are ordinary tests with all of the usual test
functionality. Setting the \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP property for a test has two
primary effects:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
CTest will ensure the test executes after all other tests which list any of
the fixtures in its \X'tty: link #prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED'\fI\%FIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP\X'tty: link' property.
.IP \(bu 2
If CTest is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular
expressions or the \fB\-\-rerun\-failed\fP option) and the cleanup test is not in
the set of tests to run, it will automatically be added if any tests in the
set require any fixture listed in \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A cleanup test can have multiple fixtures listed in its \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP
property. It will execute only once for the whole CTest run, not once for each
fixture. A fixture can also have more than one cleanup test defined. If there
are multiple cleanup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with
the usual \X'tty: link #prop_test:DEPENDS'\fI\%DEPENDS\fP\X'tty: link' test property if necessary.
.sp
A cleanup test is allowed to require other fixtures, but not any fixture listed
in its \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP property. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Ok: Dependent fixture is different to cleanup
set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES
  FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo

Cleanup tests will execute even if setup or regular tests for that fixture fail
or are skipped.
.sp
See \X'tty: link #prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED'\fI\%FIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP\X'tty: link' for a more complete discussion of how to use
test fixtures.
.SS FIXTURES_REQUIRED
.sp
Added in version 3.7.

.sp
Specifies a list of fixtures the test requires. Fixture names are case
sensitive and they are not required to have any similarity to test names.
.sp
Fixtures are a way to attach setup and cleanup tasks to a set of tests. If a
test requires a given fixture, then all tests marked as setup tasks for that
fixture will be executed first (once for the whole set of tests, not once per
test requiring the fixture). After all tests requiring a particular fixture
have completed, CTest will ensure all tests marked as cleanup tasks for that
fixture are then executed. Tests are marked as setup tasks with the
\X'tty: link #prop_test:FIXTURES_SETUP'\fI\%FIXTURES_SETUP\fP\X'tty: link' property and as cleanup tasks with the
\X'tty: link #prop_test:FIXTURES_CLEANUP'\fI\%FIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP\X'tty: link' property. If any of a fixture\(aqs setup tests fail,
all tests listing that fixture in their \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property will not
be executed. The cleanup tests for the fixture will always be executed, even if
some setup tests fail.
.sp
When CTest is asked to execute only a subset of tests (e.g. by the use of
regular expressions or when run with the \X'tty: link #cmdoption-ctest-rerun-failed'\fI\%\-\-rerun\-failed\fP\X'tty: link'
command line option), it will automatically add any setup or cleanup tests for
fixtures required by any of the tests that are in the execution set. This
behavior can be overridden with the \X'tty: link #cmdoption-ctest-FS'\fI\%\-FS\fP\X'tty: link',
\X'tty: link #cmdoption-ctest-FC'\fI\%\-FC\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #cmdoption-ctest-FA'\fI\%\-FA\fP\X'tty: link' command line options to
\X'tty: link #manual:ctest(1)'\fI\%ctest(1)\fP\X'tty: link' if desired.
.sp
Since setup and cleanup tasks are also tests, they can have an ordering
specified by the \X'tty: link #prop_test:DEPENDS'\fI\%DEPENDS\fP\X'tty: link' test property just like any other tests.
This can be exploited to implement setup or cleanup using multiple tests for a
single fixture to modularise setup or cleanup logic.
.sp
The concept of a fixture is different to that of a resource specified by
\X'tty: link #prop_test:RESOURCE_LOCK'\fI\%RESOURCE_LOCK\fP\X'tty: link', but they may be used together. A fixture defines a
set of tests which share setup and cleanup requirements, whereas a resource
lock has the effect of ensuring a particular set of tests do not run in
parallel. Some situations may need both, such as setting up a database,
serializing test access to that database and deleting the database again at the
end. For such cases, tests would populate both \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP and
\X'tty: link #prop_test:RESOURCE_LOCK'\fI\%RESOURCE_LOCK\fP\X'tty: link' to combine the two behaviors. Names used for
\X'tty: link #prop_test:RESOURCE_LOCK'\fI\%RESOURCE_LOCK\fP\X'tty: link' have no relationship with names of fixtures, so note
that a resource lock does not imply a fixture and vice versa.

similar to that mentioned above:

Key points from this example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Two fixtures are defined: \fBDB\fP and \fBFoo\fP\&. Tests can require a single
fixture as \fBfooOnly\fP and \fBdbOnly\fP do, or they can depend on multiple
fixtures like \fBdbWithFoo\fP does.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBDEPENDS\fP relationship is set up to ensure \fBsetupUsers\fP happens after
\fBcreateDB\fP, both of which are setup tests for the \fBDB\fP fixture and will
therefore be executed before the \fBdbOnly\fP and \fBdbWithFoo\fP tests
automatically.
.IP \(bu 2
No explicit \fBDEPENDS\fP relationships were needed to make the setup tests run
before or the cleanup tests run after the regular tests.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBFoo\fP fixture has no setup tests defined, only a single cleanup test.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtestsDone\fP is a cleanup test for both the \fBDB\fP and \fBFoo\fP fixtures.
Therefore, it will only execute once regular tests for both fixtures have
finished (i.e. after \fBfooOnly\fP, \fBdbOnly\fP and \fBdbWithFoo\fP). No
\fBDEPENDS\fP relationship was specified for \fBtestsDone\fP, so it is free to
run before, after or concurrently with other cleanup tests for either
fixture.
.IP \(bu 2
The setup and cleanup tests never list the fixtures they are for in their own
\fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property, as that would result in a dependency on
themselves and be considered an error.

.SS GENERATED_RESOURCE_SPEC_FILE
.sp
Added in version 3.28.

.sp
Path to the \X'tty: link #ctest-resource-dynamically-generated-spec-file'\fI\%dynamically\-generated resource spec file\fP\X'tty: link' generated by this test.
.SS LABELS
.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.  The labels are
reported in both the \fBctest\fP output summary and in dashboard submissions.
They can also be used to filter the set of tests to be executed (see the
\X'tty: link #cmdoption-ctest-L'\fI\%ctest \-L\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #cmdoption-ctest-LE'\fI\%ctest \-LE\fP\X'tty: link' options).
.sp
See \X'tty: link #additional-labels'\fI\%Additional Labels\fP\X'tty: link' for adding labels to a test dynamically during
test execution.
.SS MEASUREMENT
.sp
Specify a \fBCDASH\fP measurement and value to be reported for a test.
.sp
If set to a name then that name will be reported to \fBCDASH\fP as a named
measurement with a value of \fB1\fP\&.  You may also specify a value by
setting \fBMEASUREMENT\fP to \fBmeasurement=value\fP\&.
.SS PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
The test output (stdout or stderr) must match this regular expression
for the test to pass. The process exit code is ignored. Tests that exceed
the timeout specified by \X'tty: link #prop_test:TIMEOUT'\fI\%TIMEOUT\fP\X'tty: link' still fail regardless of
\fBPASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP\&. System\-level test failures including
segmentation faults, signal abort, or heap errors may fail the test even
if \fBPASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP is matched.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS PROCESSOR_AFFINITY
.sp
Added in version 3.12.

.sp
Set to a true value to ask CTest to launch the test process with CPU affinity
for a fixed set of processors.  If enabled and supported for the current
platform, CTest will choose a set of processors to place in the CPU affinity
mask when launching the test process.  The number of processors in the set is
determined by the \X'tty: link #prop_test:PROCESSORS'\fI\%PROCESSORS\fP\X'tty: link' test property or the number of
processors available to CTest, whichever is smaller.  The set of processors
chosen will be disjoint from the processors assigned to other concurrently
running tests that also have the \fBPROCESSOR_AFFINITY\fP property enabled.
.SS PROCESSORS
.sp
Set to specify how many process slots this test requires.
If not set, the default is \fB1\fP processor.
.sp
Denotes the number of processors that this test will require.  This is
typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction with
the \X'tty: link #command:ctest_test'\fI\%ctest_test()\fP\X'tty: link' \fBPARALLEL_LEVEL\fP option.
.sp
This will also be used to display a weighted test timing result in label and
subproject summaries in the command line output of \X'tty: link #manual:ctest(1)'\fI\%ctest(1)\fP\X'tty: link'\&. The wall
clock time for the test run will be multiplied by this property to give a
better idea of how much cpu resource CTest allocated for the test.
.sp
See also the \X'tty: link #prop_test:PROCESSOR_AFFINITY'\fI\%PROCESSOR_AFFINITY\fP\X'tty: link' test property.
.SS REQUIRED_FILES
.sp
List of files required to run the test.  The filenames are relative to the
test \X'tty: link #prop_test:WORKING_DIRECTORY'\fI\%WORKING_DIRECTORY\fP\X'tty: link' unless an absolute path is specified.
.sp
If set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of the
files exist.
.SS Examples
.sp
Suppose that \fBtest.txt\fP is created by test \fBbaseTest\fP and \fBnone.txt\fP
does not exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_test(NAME baseTest ...)   # Assumed to create test.txt
add_test(NAME fileTest ...)

# The following ensures that if baseTest is successful, test.txt will
# have been created before fileTest is run
set_tests_properties(fileTest PROPERTIES
  DEPENDS baseTest
  REQUIRED_FILES test.txt
)

add_test(NAME notRunTest ...)

# The following makes notRunTest depend on two files. Nothing creates
# the none.txt file, so notRunTest will fail with status \(dqNot Run\(dq.
set_tests_properties(notRunTest PROPERTIES
  REQUIRED_FILES \(dqtest.txt;none.txt\(dq
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above example demonstrates how \fBREQUIRED_FILES\fP works, but it is not the
most robust way to implement test ordering with failure detection.  For that,
test fixtures are a better alternative (see \X'tty: link #prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED'\fI\%FIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP\X'tty: link').
.SS RESOURCE_GROUPS
.sp
Added in version 3.16.

.sp
Specify resources required by a test, grouped in a way that is meaningful to
the test.  See \X'tty: link #ctest-resource-allocation'\fI\%resource allocation\fP\X'tty: link'
for more information on how this property integrates into the CTest resource
allocation feature.
.sp
The \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP property is a \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of group descriptions. Each entry consists of an optional
number of groups using the description followed by a series of resource
requirements for those groups. These requirements (and the number of groups)
are separated by commas. The resource requirements consist of the name of a
resource type, followed by a colon, followed by an unsigned integer
specifying the number of slots required on one resource of the given type.
.sp
The \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP property tells CTest what resources a test expects
to use grouped in a way meaningful to the test.  The test itself must read
the \X'tty: link #ctest-resource-environment-variables'\fI\%environment variables\fP\X'tty: link' to
determine which resources have been allocated to each group.  For example,
each group may correspond to a process the test will spawn when executed.
.sp
Consider the following example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND MyExe)
set_property(TEST MyTest PROPERTY RESOURCE_GROUPS
  \(dq2,gpus:2\(dq
  \(dqgpus:4,crypto_chips:2\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, there are two group descriptions (implicitly separated by a
semicolon.) The content of the first description is \fB2,gpus:2\fP\&. This
description specifies 2 groups, each of which requires 2 slots from a single
GPU. The content of the second description is \fBgpus:4,crypto_chips:2\fP\&. This
description does not specify a group count, so a default of 1 is assumed.
This single group requires 4 slots from a single GPU and 2 slots from a
single cryptography chip. In total, 3 resource groups are specified for this
test, each with its own unique requirements.
.sp
Note that the number of slots following the resource type specifies slots from
a \fIsingle\fP instance of the resource. If the resource group can tolerate
receiving slots from different instances of the same resource, it can indicate
this by splitting the specification into multiple requirements of one slot. For
example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND MyExe)
set_property(TEST MyTest PROPERTY RESOURCE_GROUPS
  \(dqgpus:1,gpus:1,gpus:1,gpus:1\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case, the single resource group indicates that it needs four GPU slots,
all of which may come from separate GPUs (though they don\(aqt have to; CTest may
still assign slots from the same GPU.)
.sp
When CTest sets the \X'tty: link #ctest-resource-environment-variables'\fI\%environment variables\fP\X'tty: link' for a test, it assigns a group number
based on the group description, starting at 0 on the left and the number of
groups minus 1 on the right. For example, in the example above, the two
groups in the first description would have IDs of 0 and 1, and the single
group in the second description would have an ID of 2.
.sp
Both the \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP and \X'tty: link #prop_test:RESOURCE_LOCK'\fI\%RESOURCE_LOCK\fP\X'tty: link' properties serve
similar purposes, but they are distinct and orthogonal. Resources specified by
\fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP do not affect \X'tty: link #prop_test:RESOURCE_LOCK'\fI\%RESOURCE_LOCK\fP\X'tty: link', and vice versa.
Whereas \X'tty: link #prop_test:RESOURCE_LOCK'\fI\%RESOURCE_LOCK\fP\X'tty: link' is a simpler property that is used for
locking one global resource, \fBRESOURCE_GROUPS\fP is a more advanced property
that allows multiple tests to simultaneously use multiple resources of the
same type, specifying their requirements in a fine\-grained manner.
.SS RESOURCE_LOCK
.sp
Specify a list of resources that are locked by this test.
.sp
If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they are guaranteed
not to run concurrently.
.sp
See also \X'tty: link #prop_test:FIXTURES_REQUIRED'\fI\%FIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP\X'tty: link' if the resource requires any setup or
cleanup steps.

.SS RUN_SERIAL
.sp
Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.
.sp
Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test \fBPARALLEL_LEVEL\fP
option to specify that this test should not be run in parallel with
any other tests.
.SS SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
Added in version 3.16.

.sp
If the test output (stderr or stdout) matches this regular expression the test
will be marked as skipped, regardless of the process exit code. Tests that
exceed the timeout specified by \X'tty: link #prop_test:TIMEOUT'\fI\%TIMEOUT\fP\X'tty: link' still fail regardless of
\fBSKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP\&. System\-level test failures including segmentation
faults, signal abort, or heap errors may fail the test even if the regular

.SS SKIP_RETURN_CODE
.sp
Return code to mark a test as skipped.

Sometimes only a test itself can determine if all requirements for the
test are met. If such a situation should not be considered a hard failure
a return code of the process can be specified that will mark the test as
\fBNot Run\fP if it is encountered. Valid values are in the range of
0 to 255, inclusive.

.SS TIMEOUT
.sp
How many seconds to allow for this test.

.SS Description
.sp
Allow a test \fBseconds\fP to complete after \fBregex\fP is encountered in
its output.
.sp
When the test outputs a line that matches \fBregex\fP its start time is
reset to the current time and its timeout duration is changed to
\fBseconds\fP\&.  Prior to this, the timeout duration is determined by the
\X'tty: link #prop_test:TIMEOUT'\fI\%TIMEOUT\fP\X'tty: link' property or the \X'tty: link #variable:CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT'\fI\%CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT\fP\X'tty: link'
variable if either of these are set.  Because the test\(aqs start time is
reset, its execution time will not include any time that was spent
waiting for the matching output.
.sp
\fBTIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH\fP is useful for avoiding spurious
timeouts when your test must wait for some system resource to become
available before it can execute.  Set \X'tty: link #prop_test:TIMEOUT'\fI\%TIMEOUT\fP\X'tty: link' to a longer
duration that accounts for resource acquisition and use
\fBTIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH\fP to control how long the actual test
is allowed to run.
.sp
If the required resource can be controlled by CTest you should use
\X'tty: link #prop_test:RESOURCE_LOCK'\fI\%RESOURCE_LOCK\fP\X'tty: link' instead of \fBTIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH\fP\&.
This property should be used when only the test itself can determine
when its required resources are available.
.sp
See also \X'tty: link #prop_test:TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_NAME'\fI\%TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_NAME\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_GRACE_PERIOD

Added in version 3.27.

.sp
If the \X'tty: link #prop_test:TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_NAME'\fI\%TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_NAME\fP\X'tty: link' test property is set, this property
specifies the number of seconds to wait for a test process to terminate after
sending the custom signal.  Otherwise, this property has no meaning.
.sp
The grace period may be any real value greater than \fB0.0\fP, but not greater
than \fB60.0\fP\&.  If this property is not set, the default is \fB1.0\fP second.
.sp
This is available only on platforms supporting POSIX signals.
It is not available on Windows.
.SS TIMEOUT_SIGNAL_NAME
.sp
Added in version 3.27.

.sp
Specify a custom signal to send to a test process when its timeout is reached.
This is available only on platforms supporting POSIX signals.
It is not available on Windows.
.sp
The name must be one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0

list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax \fBVAR\fP or \fBVAR=value\fP\&.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).  This property may be set on a per\-configuration basis using
the name \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>\fP where \fB<CONFIG>\fP is an upper\-case
name (ex.  \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG\fP).
.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.  Xcode does not support per\-configuration
definitions on source files.
.sp
Added in version 3.26: Any leading \fB\-D\fP on an item will be removed.

.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

.SS COMPILE_FLAGS
.sp
Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.

.SS CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES
.sp
Added in version 3.28.

.sp
\fBCXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES\fP is a boolean specifying whether CMake will scan the
source for C++ module dependencies.  See also the
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES'\fI\%CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES\fP\X'tty: link' for target\-wide settings.
.sp
When this property is set \fBON\fP, CMake will scan the source at build time and
add module dependency information to the compile line as necessary.  When this
property is set \fBOFF\fP, CMake will not scan the source at build time.  When
this property is unset, the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES'\fI\%CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES\fP\X'tty: link' property is
consulted.
.sp
Note that scanning is only performed if C++20 or higher is enabled for the
target and the source uses the \fBCXX\fP language.  Scanning for modules in
sources belonging to file sets of type \fBCXX_MODULES\fP is always performed.
.SS EXTERNAL_OBJECT
.sp
If set to true then this is an object file.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBTrue\fP then the source file is really an
object file and should not be compiled.  It will still be linked into
the target though.
.SS Fortran_FORMAT
.sp
Set to \fBFIXED\fP or \fBFREE\fP to indicate the Fortran source layout.
.sp
This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source file uses
fixed\-format or free\-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding format flag
to the compiler.  Consider using the target\-wide \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:Fortran_FORMAT'\fI\%Fortran_FORMAT\fP\X'tty: link'
property if all source files in a target share the same format.

.SS Fortran_PREPROCESS
.sp
Added in version 3.18.

.sp
Control whether the Fortran source file should be unconditionally preprocessed.
.sp
If unset or empty, rely on the compiler to determine whether the file
should be preprocessed. If explicitly set to \fBOFF\fP then the file
does not need to be preprocessed. If explicitly set to \fBON\fP, then
the file does need to be preprocessed as part of the compilation step.
.sp
When using the \X'tty: link #generator:Ninja'\fI\%Ninja\fP\X'tty: link' generator, all source files are
first preprocessed in order to generate module dependency
information. Setting this property to \fBOFF\fP will make \fBNinja\fP
skip this step.
.sp
Consider using the target\-wide \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:Fortran_PREPROCESS'\fI\%Fortran_PREPROCESS\fP\X'tty: link' property
if all source files in a target need to be preprocessed.
.SS GENERATED
.sp
Is this source file generated as part of the build or CMake process.
.sp
Changed in version 3.20: Turning on the \fBGENERATED\fP source file property in one directory allows
the associated source file to be used across directories without the need
to manually setting that property for other directory scopes, too.
Additionally, it may now be set only to boolean values, and may not be
turned off once turned on.  See policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0118'\fI\%CMP0118\fP\X'tty: link'\&.

.sp
Changed in version 3.30: Whether or not a source file is generated is an all\-or\-nothing global
property of the source.  Consequently, the \fBGENERATED\fP source file
property is now visible in all directories.  See policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0163'\fI\%CMP0163\fP\X'tty: link'\&.

.sp
Tells the internal CMake engine that a source file is generated by an outside
process such as another build step, or the execution of CMake itself.
This information is then used to exempt the file from any existence or
validity checks.

for any target in the same directory scope (which usually means the same
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file), CMake will automatically create a dependency to
make sure the file is generated before building that target.
.sp
The \X'tty: link #makefile-generators'\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP\X'tty: link' will remove \fBGENERATED\fP files during
\fBmake clean\fP\&.

be shown. For the special case of sources generated by CMake\(aqs \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOMOC'\fI\%AUTOMOC\fP\X'tty: link',
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTORCC'\fI\%AUTORCC\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:AUTOUIC'\fI\%AUTOUIC\fP\X'tty: link' functionality, the

properties may influence where the generated sources are grouped in the project\(aqs
file lists.
.SS HEADER_FILE_ONLY
.sp
Is this source file only a header file.
.sp
A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a
header file with no associated implementation.  This is set
automatically based on the file extension and is used by CMake to
determine if certain dependency information should be computed.
.sp
By setting this property to \fBON\fP, you can disable compilation of
the given source file, even if it should be compiled because it is
part of the library\(aqs/executable\(aqs sources.
.sp
This is useful if you have some source files which you somehow
pre\-process, and then add these pre\-processed sources via
\X'tty: link #command:add_library'\fI\%add_library()\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link #command:add_executable'\fI\%add_executable()\fP\X'tty: link'\&. Normally, in IDE,
there would be no reference of the original sources, only of these
pre\-processed sources. So by setting this property for all the original
source files to \fBON\fP, and then either calling \X'tty: link #command:add_library'\fI\%add_library()\fP\X'tty: link'
or \X'tty: link #command:add_executable'\fI\%add_executable()\fP\X'tty: link' while passing both the pre\-processed
sources and the original sources, or by using \X'tty: link #command:target_sources'\fI\%target_sources()\fP\X'tty: link'
to add original source files will do exactly what would one expect, i.e.
the original source files would be visible in IDE, and will not be built.
.SS INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
Added in version 3.11.

.sp
List of preprocessor include file search directories.
.sp
This property holds a \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of paths
and will be added to the list of include directories when this
source file builds. These directories will take precedence over directories
defined at target level except for \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' generator due to technical
limitations.
.sp
Relative paths should not be added to this property directly.
.sp
Contents of \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use \(dqgenerator expressions\(dq with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%cmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP\X'tty: link' manual
for available expressions.  However, \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' does not support
per\-config per\-source settings, so expressions that depend on the build
configuration are not allowed with that generator.
.SS KEEP_EXTENSION
.sp
Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.
.sp
If this property is set then the file extension of the output file
will be the same as that of the source file.  Normally the output file
extension is computed based on the language of the source file, for
example \fB\&.cxx\fP will go to a \fB\&.o\fP extension.
.SS LABELS
.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.
.sp
This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a
target whose \fBLABELS\fP property is also set.  No other semantics are
currently specified.
.SS LANGUAGE
.sp
Specify the programming language in which a source file is written.
.sp
A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the
source file is.  If it is not set the language is determined based on
the file extension.  Typical values are \fBCXX\fP (i.e.  C++), \fBC\fP,
\fBCSharp\fP, \fBCUDA\fP, \fBFortran\fP, \fBHIP\fP, \fBISPC\fP, and \fBASM\fP\&.  Setting
this property for a file means this file will be compiled, unless
\X'tty: link #prop_sf:HEADER_FILE_ONLY'\fI\%HEADER_FILE_ONLY\fP\X'tty: link' is set.
.sp
Changed in version 3.20: Setting this property causes the source file to be compiled as the
specified language, using explicit flags if possible.  Previously it
only caused the specified language\(aqs compiler to be used.
See policy \X'tty: link #policy:CMP0119'\fI\%CMP0119\fP\X'tty: link'\&.

.SS LOCATION
.sp
The full path to a source file.
.sp
A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path to
the source file.
.SS MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
.sp
Place a source file inside a Application Bundle
(\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACOSX_BUNDLE'\fI\%MACOSX_BUNDLE\fP\X'tty: link'), Core Foundation Bundle (\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUNDLE'\fI\%BUNDLE\fP\X'tty: link'),
or Framework Bundle (\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FRAMEWORK'\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link').  It is applicable for macOS
and iOS.
.sp
Executable targets with the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:MACOSX_BUNDLE'\fI\%MACOSX_BUNDLE\fP\X'tty: link' property set are
built as macOS or iOS application bundles on Apple platforms.  Shared
library targets with the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:FRAMEWORK'\fI\%FRAMEWORK\fP\X'tty: link' property set are built as
macOS or iOS frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library targets with
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:BUNDLE'\fI\%BUNDLE\fP\X'tty: link' property set are built as macOS \fBCFBundle\fP bundles
on Apple platforms.  Source files listed in the target with this property
set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content
folder specified by the property value.  For macOS Application Bundles the
content folder is \fB<name>.app/Contents\fP\&.  For macOS Frameworks the
content folder is \fB<name>.framework/Versions/<version>\fP\&.  For macOS
CFBundles the content folder is \fB<name>.bundle/Contents\fP (unless the
extension is changed).  See the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:PUBLIC_HEADER'\fI\%PUBLIC_HEADER\fP\X'tty: link',
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:PRIVATE_HEADER'\fI\%PRIVATE_HEADER\fP\X'tty: link', and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:RESOURCE'\fI\%RESOURCE\fP\X'tty: link' target properties for
specifying files meant for \fBHeaders\fP, \fBPrivateHeaders\fP, or
\fBResources\fP directories.
.sp
If the specified location is equal to \fBResources\fP, the resulting location
will be the same as if the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:RESOURCE'\fI\%RESOURCE\fP\X'tty: link' property had been used. If
the specified location is a sub\-folder of \fBResources\fP, it will be placed
into the respective sub\-folder. Note: For iOS Apple uses a flat bundle layout
where no \fBResources\fP folder exist. Therefore CMake strips the \fBResources\fP
folder name from the specified location.
.SS OBJECT_DEPENDS
.sp
Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.
.sp
Specifies a \X'tty: link #cmake-language-lists'\fI\%semicolon\-separated list\fP\X'tty: link' of full\-paths to
files on which any object files compiled from this source file depend.
On \X'tty: link #makefile-generators'\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP\X'tty: link' and the \X'tty: link #generator:Ninja'\fI\%Ninja\fP\X'tty: link' generator an
object file will be recompiled if any of the named files is newer than it.
\X'tty: link #visual-studio-generators'\fI\%Visual Studio Generators\fP\X'tty: link' and the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' generator
cannot implement such compilation dependencies.
.sp
This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source
file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although the
property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer
necessary.  If the generated header file is created by a custom
command in the same target as the source file, the automatic
dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency.  If the
generated header file is created by another target, an inter\-target
dependency should be created with the \X'tty: link #command:add_dependencies'\fI\%add_dependencies()\fP\X'tty: link'
command (if one does not already exist due to linking relationships).
.SS OBJECT_OUTPUTS
.sp
Additional outputs for a \X'tty: link #generator:Ninja'\fI\%Ninja\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link #makefile-generators'\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP\X'tty: link' rule.
.sp
Additional outputs created by compilation of this source file.  If any
of these outputs is missing the object will be recompiled.  This is
supported only on the \X'tty: link #generator:Ninja'\fI\%Ninja\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link #makefile-generators'\fI\%Makefile Generators\fP\X'tty: link'
and will be ignored on other generators.
.sp
This property supports
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'\&.

.SS SKIP_LINTING
.sp
Added in version 3.27.

.sp
This property allows you to exclude a specific source file
from the linting process. The linting process involves running
tools such as \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:<LANG>_CPPLINT'\fI\%<LANG>_CPPLINT\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY'\fI\%<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY\fP\X'tty: link',
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:<LANG>_CPPCHECK'\fI\%<LANG>_CPPCHECK\fP\X'tty: link', and \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE'\fI\%<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE\fP\X'tty: link'
on the source files, as well as compiling header files as part of
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS'\fI\%VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS\fP\X'tty: link'\&. By setting \fBSKIP_LINTING\fP on a
source file, the mentioned linting tools will not be executed for that
particular file.
.SS Example
.sp
Consider a C++ project that includes multiple source files,
such as \fBmain.cpp\fP, \fBthings.cpp\fP, and \fBgeneratedBindings.cpp\fP\&.
In this example, you want to exclude the \fBgeneratedBindings.cpp\fP
file from the linting process. To achieve this, you can utilize
the \fBSKIP_LINTING\fP property with the \X'tty: link #command:set_source_files_properties'\fI\%set_source_files_properties()\fP\X'tty: link'
command as shown below:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

set_source_files_properties(generatedBindings.cpp PROPERTIES
    SKIP_LINTING ON
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the provided code snippet, the \fBSKIP_LINTING\fP property is set to true
for the \fBgeneratedBindings.cpp\fP source file. As a result, when the linting
tools specified by \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:<LANG>_CPPLINT'\fI\%<LANG>_CPPLINT\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY'\fI\%<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY\fP\X'tty: link',
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:<LANG>_CPPCHECK'\fI\%<LANG>_CPPCHECK\fP\X'tty: link', or \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE'\fI\%<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE\fP\X'tty: link'
are executed, they will skip analyzing the \fBgeneratedBindings.cpp\fP file.
.sp
By using the \fBSKIP_LINTING\fP property, you can selectively exclude specific
source files from the linting process. This allows you to focus the
linting tools on the relevant parts of your project, enhancing the efficiency
and effectiveness of the linting workflow.
.SS SKIP_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS
.sp
Added in version 3.16.

.sp
Is this source file skipped by \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:PRECOMPILE_HEADERS'\fI\%PRECOMPILE_HEADERS\fP\X'tty: link' feature.

This property helps with build problems that one would run into
when using the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:PRECOMPILE_HEADERS'\fI\%PRECOMPILE_HEADERS\fP\X'tty: link' feature.
.sp
One example would be the usage of Objective\-C (\fB*.m\fP) files, and
Objective\-C++ (\fB*.mm\fP) files, which lead to compilation failure
because they are treated (in case of Ninja / Makefile generator)
as C, and CXX respectively. The precompile headers are not
compatible between languages.
.SS SKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION
.sp
Added in version 3.16.

.sp
Setting this property to true ensures the source file will be skipped by
unity builds when its associated target has its \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD\fP\X'tty: link'
property set to true.  The source file will instead be compiled on its own
in the same way as it would with unity builds disabled.
.sp
This property helps with \(dqODR (One definition rule)\(dq problems where combining
a particular source file with others might lead to build errors or other
unintended side effects.
.sp
Note that sources which are scanned for C++ modules (see
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-cxxmodules(7)'\fI\%cmake\-cxxmodules(7)\fP\X'tty: link') are not eligible for unity build inclusion and
will automatically be excluded.
.SS Swift_DEPENDENCIES_FILE
.sp
Added in version 3.15.

.sp
This property sets the path for the Swift dependency file (swiftdeps) for the
source.  If one is not specified, it will default to \fB<OBJECT>.swiftdeps\fP\&.
.SS Swift_DIAGNOSTICS_FILE
.sp
Added in version 3.15.

.sp
This property controls where the Swift diagnostics are serialized.
.SS SYMBOLIC
.sp
Is this just a name for a rule.
.sp
If \fBSYMBOLIC\fP (boolean) is set to \fBTrue\fP the build system will be informed
that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used
as a symbolic name for a build rule.
.SS UNITY_GROUP
.sp
Added in version 3.18.

.sp
This property controls which \fIbucket\fP the source will be part of when
the \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:UNITY_BUILD_MODE'\fI\%UNITY_BUILD_MODE\fP\X'tty: link' is set to \fBGROUP\fP\&.
.SS VS_COPY_TO_OUT_DIR
.sp
Added in version 3.8.

.sp
Sets the \fB<CopyToOutputDirectory>\fP tag for a source file in a
Visual Studio project file. Valid values are \fBNever\fP, \fBAlways\fP
and \fBPreserveNewest\fP\&.
.SS VS_CSHARP_<tagname>
.sp
Added in version 3.8.

.sp
Visual Studio and CSharp source\-file\-specific configuration.
.sp
Tell the \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generators(7)'\fI\%Visual Studio generators\fP\X'tty: link'
to set the source file tag \fB<tagname>\fP
to a given value in the generated Visual Studio CSharp
project. Ignored on other generators and languages. This property
can be used to define dependencies between source files or set any
other Visual Studio specific parameters.

.sp
Mark a source file as content for deployment with a Windows Phone or
Windows Store application when built with a
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generators(7)'\fI\%Visual Studio generators\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
The value must evaluate to either \fB1\fP or \fB0\fP and may use
\X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)'\fI\%generator expressions\fP\X'tty: link'
to make the choice based on the build configuration.
The \fB\&.vcxproj\fP file entry for the source file will be
marked either \fBDeploymentContent\fP or \fBExcludedFromBuild\fP
for values \fB1\fP and \fB0\fP, respectively.
.SS VS_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION
.sp
Added in version 3.1.

.sp
Specifies the deployment location for a content source file with a Windows
Phone or Windows Store application when built
with a \X'tty: link #manual:cmake-generators(7)'\fI\%Visual Studio generators\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
This property is only applicable when using \X'tty: link #prop_sf:VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT'\fI\%VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
The value represent the path relative to the app package and applies to all
configurations.
.SS VS_INCLUDE_IN_VSIX
.sp
Added in version 3.8.

.sp
Boolean property to specify if the file should be included within a
VSIX (Visual Studio Integration Extension) extension package.
This is needed for development of Visual Studio extensions.
.SS VS_RESOURCE_GENERATOR
.sp
Added in version 3.8.

.sp
This property allows to specify the resource generator to be used
on this file. It defaults to \fBPublicResXFileCodeGenerator\fP if
not set.
.sp
This property only applies to C# projects.
.SS VS_SETTINGS
.sp
Added in version 3.18.

.sp
Set any item metadata on a file.
.sp
Added in version 3.22: This property is honored for all source file types.
Previously it worked only for non\-built files.

.sp
Takes a list of \fBKey=Value\fP pairs. Tells the Visual Studio generator to set
\fBKey\fP to \fBValue\fP as item metadata on the file.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_property(SOURCE file.hlsl PROPERTY VS_SETTINGS \(dqKey=Value\(dq \(dqKey2=Value2\(dq)
.ft P

\fB\-Od\fP flag to the command line for the FxCompiler tool.  Specify the value
\fBtrue\fP for this property to disable compiler optimizations.
.SS VS_SHADER_ENABLE_DEBUG
.sp
Added in version 3.11.

.sp
Enable debugging information for an \fB\&.hlsl\fP source file.  This adds the
\fB\-Zi\fP flag to the command line for the FxCompiler tool.  Specify the value
\fBtrue\fP to generate debugging information for the compiled shader.
.SS VS_SHADER_ENTRYPOINT
.sp
Added in version 3.1.

.sp
Specifies the name of the entry point for the shader of a \fB\&.hlsl\fP source
file.
.SS VS_SHADER_FLAGS
.sp
Added in version 3.2.

.sp
Set additional Visual Studio shader flags of a \fB\&.hlsl\fP source file.
.SS VS_SHADER_MODEL
.sp
Added in version 3.1.

.sp
Specifies the shader model of a \fB\&.hlsl\fP source file. Some shader types can
only be used with recent shader models
.SS VS_SHADER_OBJECT_FILE_NAME
.sp
Added in version 3.12.

.sp
Specifies a file name for the compiled shader object file for an \fB\&.hlsl\fP
source file.  This adds the \fB\-Fo\fP flag to the command line for the FxCompiler
tool.
.SS VS_SHADER_OUTPUT_HEADER_FILE
.sp
Added in version 3.10.

.sp
Set filename for output header file containing object code of a \fB\&.hlsl\fP
source file.

with a new tool not based on the extension of the file.
.SS VS_XAML_TYPE
.sp
Added in version 3.3.

.sp
Mark a Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) source file
as a different type than the default \fBPage\fP\&.
The most common usage would be to set the default \fBApp.xaml\fP file as
\fBApplicationDefinition\fP\&.
.SS WRAP_EXCLUDE
.sp
Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.
.sp
Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to
provide additional functionality.
.sp
For example, C++ code can be wrapped into Java or Python, using SWIG.
If \fBWRAP_EXCLUDE\fP is set to \fBTrue\fP, that indicates that this
source file should not be wrapped.
.SS XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE
.sp
Added in version 3.1.

.sp
Set the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' \fBexplicitFileType\fP attribute on its reference to a
source file.  CMake computes a default based on file extension but
can be told explicitly with this property.
.sp
See also \X'tty: link #prop_sf:XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE'\fI\%XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS XCODE_FILE_ATTRIBUTES
.sp
Added in version 3.7.

.sp
Add values to the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' \fBATTRIBUTES\fP setting on its reference to a
source file.  Among other things, this can be used to set the role on
a \fB\&.mig\fP file:

.sp
Set the \X'tty: link #generator:Xcode'\fI\%Xcode\fP\X'tty: link' \fBlastKnownFileType\fP attribute on its reference to
a source file.  CMake computes a default based on file extension but
can be told explicitly with this property.
.sp
See also \X'tty: link #prop_sf:XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE'\fI\%XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE\fP\X'tty: link', which is preferred
over this property if set.
.SH PROPERTIES ON CACHE ENTRIES
.SS ADVANCED
.sp
True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.
.sp
This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered
interesting only for advanced configuration.  The \X'tty: link #command:mark_as_advanced'\fI\%mark_as_advanced()\fP\X'tty: link'
command modifies this property.
.SS HELPSTRING
.sp
Help associated with entry in GUIs.
.sp
This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help users set it
through a CMake GUI.
.SS MODIFIED
.sp
Internal management property.  Do not set or get.
.sp
This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track
interactive user modification of entries.  Ignore it.
.SS STRINGS
.sp
Enumerate possible \fBSTRING\fP entry values for GUI selection.
.sp
For cache entries with type \fBSTRING\fP, this enumerates a set of values.
CMake GUIs may use this to provide a selection widget instead of a
generic string entry field.  This is for convenience only.  CMake does
not enforce that the value matches one of those listed.
.SS TYPE
.sp
Widget type for entry in GUIs.
.sp
Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present widgets
to help users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a hint to
determine the widget type.  Valid \fBTYPE\fP values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
PATH          = Path to a directory.
FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
STRING        = Generic string value.
INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Generally the \fBTYPE\fP of a cache entry should be set by the command which
creates it ( \X'tty: link #command:set'\fI\%set()\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #command:option'\fI\%option()\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link #command:find_library'\fI\%find_library()\fP\X'tty: link', etc.).
.SS VALUE
.sp
Value of a cache entry.
.sp
This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting this
property always sets the value without checking, so use with care.

.UNINDENT

.sp
Setting \fBIMPORTED_NO_SYSTEM\fP to true on an

Entries of \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' are not treated
as system include directories when compiling consumers (regardless of
the value of the consumed target\(aqs \X'tty: link #prop_tgt:SYSTEM'\fI\%SYSTEM\fP\X'tty: link' property), as they
would be by default.   Entries of
\X'tty: link #prop_tgt:INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES'\fI\%INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\X'tty: link' are not affected,

.IP \(bu 2
On Apple platforms, when the target is a framework, it will not be treated as

.UNINDENT
.sp
This property can also be enabled on a non\-imported target.  Doing so does

.SS IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED
.sp
Added in version 3.5.

.sp
Deprecated since version 3.28: \fI\%IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED\fP was designed to make universal binaries
containing iOS/arm* device code paired with iOS Simulator/x86_64 code
(or similar for other Apple embedded platforms). Universal binaries can only
differentiate code based on CPU type, so this only made sense before the
days of arm64 macOS machines (i.e. iOS Simulator/arm64). Apple now
recommends xcframeworks, which contain multiple binaries for different
platforms, for this use case.

.sp
Build a combined (device and simulator) target when installing.
.sp
When this property is set to false, which is the default, then it will
either be built with the device SDK or the simulator SDK depending on the SDK
set. But if this property is set to true then the target will at install time
also be built for the other SDK and combined into one library.
